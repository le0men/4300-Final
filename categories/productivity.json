      "It's good. I used to photo option when shopping for hardware supplies that I was completely overwhelmed by today. I often use the audio input option to build out study guides with material for tech certifications and sometimes it will randomly add weird stuff to what I've said. Often it adds \"thanks for watching!\" But otherwise it is great.",
      "I upgraded to the paid version because I wanted more recent results (4/2023 instead some time in 2022). Ever since then it is very slow, halting, stops in the middle of an answer, and frequently provides incorrect and even ludicrous answers. I'm canceling and going back to the free version, which was fantastic. I'd be happy to pay if it worked right. Very disappointing and annoying",
      "Been using this as a research tool for a big writing project, and it's EXTREMELY helpful. You can give it a whole paragraph of highly specific questions, and get perfectly relevant, detailed, well sourced responses. I've used it for many other things like travel, and it comes in handy anytime you need info of any kind really. I haven't used the vocal features, so I can't attest to those. But if you're a writer or any kind of human really, the research aspect is extremely useful.",
      "I love this thing. It has 10x'd me productivity and completely transformed the way I learn, my workflow, the volume and quality of my output, and amazed me in countless ways. The Whisper integration really tops it off. To have this voice with inflection delivering the responses with all the amazing logical reasoning capabilities of GPT4 is just... amazing. On long drives, I have some of the best two-way conversations with this thing I could go on forever but I'm running out of space. I LOVE this",
      "UPDATE: I think the app is failing due to a tracker buried in the recent versions. DuckDuckGo is blocking repeated attempts of this app attempting to phone home with my device details and PII. The update installed on 2024.02.09 is not working. I am unable to connect to the service and receive the following error, \" Unable to connect, try again later.\" The app was working perfectly prior to the update."

It's ridiculous and a waste of time. Why can't the ad be short like 5 or 10 seconds? Or at least none to begin with?",
      "So far my information is safe and secure, while not being intruded by the unwanted advertising, and(or) personal information sharing. So far, PDF reader(basics) is a free service, more versitile, and easy to convert documents from other apps(eg., banks, microsoft, windows, outlook, etc,.); and I have yet to transverse platforms, such as copying my home computer docs.(AKA, pdf or ms document formats) . So far so good, but we shall see if this app can continue offering these benifits & options.üëç",
      "Dude the advertising is dumb. Gets in the way. After every file I opened, I had to watch a clip or click the X in the top corner which somehow most of the time took me to the advertisement webpage! {Instead of simply X` ing out like it should. I'd have to click back a few times just to try click the X again... JUST TO GET BACK TO MY DOCUMENT I was just viewing, or to folder where I was simply just trying to view the files and find which one I needed}. Tedious & def not worth ad free paid version",
      "Great PDF Reader! You can highlight, copy the text, rename the file, etc. The menu is clean, organized, and easy to manipulate files in. I was just looking to highlight text in my pdfs, so this meets my needs fine. Please note there is a brief ad when switching files and a banner ad when viewing a file. Thanks to the team/developer for making this absolutely free!",
      "Sorry, I am not willing to sit through a 3-minute unskippable misleading ad for a game I've seen a million times just to open a PDF that my wife sent me. (In response to developer and another user) I totally get that ads are a source of revenue. I'm not opposed to them at all. But when the ad is literally three minutes long, cannot be skipped without closing the app, and is the very first thing I see when I launch it for the first time, that doesn't leave a good impression at all."

      "I installed Instabridge just to check it out. First time trying to use it and all I had was a list of \"rarely works\" Wi-Fi options. I wish I could get back the time it took me to install the app and now delete the app. I could have spent that 4 minutes, watching some senseless YouTube video and felt better about the lost time.",
      "Instabridge,is by far the best app for hooking onto and into any wifi so you can get on line when it counts the most, not to mention the stability is awesome the other apps I have tried don't even come close in comparison. delete all the other apps that claim connection to wifi and map it out , cause this app will be the only app you will ever need.",
      "Absolutely awful! It completely took over my phone, rearranged EVERYTHING. Constant ads everywhere. When you really look at the permissions, you see that this app has now become the system your phone works on and everything that that entails. Oh yeah, it also downloads apps and files... Without your authorization of course. And you have to do some research to uninstall it, because that feature is also not available. NO!!!!",
      "This app ruins my phone and wouldn't let me delete it, I did not really commend you downloading it, and it damages the Wi-Fi in the places you're at, I download it, and this is happened, I really don't recommend it, and you will get in trouble for it in that place, and it completely changes your phone, iPad, whatever you using, and you can slide and ads will pop up. When you're trying to open your phone, don't download it. Really don't recommend. This will ruinwhatever you're using!",
      "I would rate this less than one star, but that is not possible, I completely takes over your browser and it adds files, downloads, apps without your permission, and it will completely take over your phone and I'll give you ads randomly when you on your homescreen and it randomly pops up with stuff on your home screen. It pops up with a whole lot of Internet stuff and if you try to click on the Internet it doesn't really work because it tells you to get a password and permission from the owner"

      "You have to pay for a subscription to even view files with this app. Any time I try to open a PDF, I get a \"Try Acrobat Premium\" message that requires either a subscription purchase or a \"free 7 day trial\" with credit card info and automatic payment after the 7 days. If I try to close the pop up message or tap the back button, it closes the entire app. In short, the app is useless without a $70/year subscription.",
      "I need a simple workflow - download PDF, open PDF. I installed Adobe because I trust they won't install spyware. EVERY time this app opens, it pops-up ad to try the 7-day premium editing features. No problem, just close the window. But then it doesn't show the file I just downloaded?! THEN, I try to open the file, and it lists them alphabetically with no option to sort by download date. FAIL! I uninstalled.",
      "The app would be great but for the constant nags to try a streamlined reading mode, even if you use it all the time, even including occasional full-screen pop over nags when you just want to open a doc to take a quick peek. In addition, it constantly highlights features that are not available without a paid monthly subscription. This app is basically an advertisement for a paid monthly subscription for features I rarely need. Regretfully uninstalling, as I really like the core functionality.",
      "It's very helpful to be able to choose the information you want to appear on my charts and graphs that reflect my average glucose levels. Plus, I can choose a 2, 7, 14, or 30-day time frame to be reflected on my data charts. All in 30 seconds. I can view this information on Samsung Notes, Acrobat, or several other options. I'm not savvy online, but the Dexcom Clariy App is easy for me to use. My new Dexcom G7 has changed my Diabetes control in positive ways!",
      "I have been using this reader on my phone for several months now and if this phone had a larger screen I'd be on cloud 9. The app works primarily the same as the software for your desktop or laptop. I am truly interested in checking out the fully armed app and finding out what features that I'm missing out on. I've been dabbling with computers and software since the early 80's and I consider Adobe one of the better software companies.They seem to have a an outstanding quality control department."

      "WAY too many ads!!!! It's insane trying to open a simple PDF. It was no love loss for me to uninstall. It's this way with most free applications that have anything to do with an office type needs. I find this disheartening because it seems Microsoft has free reign, while smaller developers have no chance of finding their small space in the market of a giant conglomerate.",
      "This app closes out the file when you minimize it, doesn't remember your place, prevents you from using other functions simultaneously (like volume for some reason), has a finicky zoom feature that might jump you to a completely different scroll point in the document, harasses you with push notifications, and is really difficult to close thanks to one of the most insidious ad placement systems I've yet seen. I didn't even use it for editing‚Äîit was such a chore to read docs alone. Can't recommend",
      "Literally just horrible. App is slow and glitchy and straight up locked me inside of the app trying to swipe out but the app page would pop back up instantaneously after trying to close the app. Had to turn off my phone and let it sit for a minute before I was finally able to delete the app. Let alone nothing loads in the app even with given file permission. This app is sketch even if it works well for others. Fix your problems.",
      "It's a great app but if u need to use it for free u will have to watch a 2 min add ,then you won't have to pay for the feature you need. example: your signature. Underlining and so on..u get the idea. But I truly love that it keeps track of your documents in a file system that make everything easier to find things...ty for that.",
      "It's says PDF editing although it won't convert your document to allow editing. A doc that is save can only be viewed unless you spend wasteful amount of time saving it in other apps for editing. Text box editing doesn't line up and opens a canvas. It looks pretty but waste a lot of your time. The pen is not for signing because it doesn't show the writing."

      "Opened a document using PDF, after viewing closed out of documents and returned to regular use. Busy at work for several hours prevented further use, and when I turned my phone on, or tried to turn it on, discovered that the battery was completely dead. Strange how that happened, being as my phone was not in use. After some time I managed to be able to check the recharge process, 7% in 2 hours, change charger and connecting cables, next morning(7-9 hours later) 86 %, CAUSE: PDF running in back",
      "For the most part it's good. I like that I can print a good amount of pdf's at once. Just one problem that needs fixed. Sometimes I'm missing a image from the file when I go to add an image there might be one that doesn't show up and I don't understand why I can't convert it to a pdf with my other images. Like today I was only able to make 9 out of 10 images to PDFs. Because the image isn't showing up to use. Can some one explain? (update: it showed up after a few times resaving image from sms)",
      "Sure, I can describe the experience of a PDF! A PDF, short for Portable Document Format, is a file format that allows you to view and share documents in a consistent and reliable way. It's like a digital paper that maintains the original formatting, fonts, and images, regardless of the device or operating system you use. PDFs are great for sharing important documents, like resumes, contracts, or reports, because they preserve the layout and can be easily opened by anyone with a PDF reader. It's",
      "Great. I actually downloaded a pdf reader before this. But its problem was that it took too long to load up. I discovered this one and it's great. Although it bugs me a little with some ads but never with video ads. Only thing i ask is if you could make a dark mode available. Thanks to yall",
      "I am really frustrated with the ads and the inability to dismiss them or to close out of the PDF program when we are finished. I need to figure out how my emails could be opened, viewed and printed before without this app. Very poor service."

      "My printer fully relies on an app, which I'd never have gotten if I knew it was this bad. The app has been giving me grief for a while due to my printer disconnecting regularly and the app failing to process print jobs and giving no reason. Now my printer has ceased functioning entirely because the app simply says there's \"a problem with the printer\", No hint as to what. I just put in new ink cartridges and the report pages print fine. If it's not too late, don't waste your time with HP.",
      "My issue is with the update done on the HP SMART APP. The update no longer allows you to do a printer scan using the mobile HP SMART APP. It gives an error message as follows: Feature Unavailable This feature is not supported by the selected printer, Connect to a different printer to use this feature. Contact HP Support. The app used to work perfectly from a mobile phone. Now it's awful. Why don't HP just fix the app the way it was to allow printer scanning from the mobile app. So frustrating!!!",
      "Horrible!! I absolutely abhore this app and their printers. You need a subscription to use certain inks cartridges or it won't print. The printer is always glitching out so it doesn't print. To be able to use the printer you have to turn on all these intrusive settings. The printer is extremely slow. All I want is to have a printer that connects easily and prints easily. This company fails to provide that. Extremely frustrating product - now we need subscriptions to use printers. Horrendous.",
      "if I didn't have to power it off and unplug every time I needed to use it, this would be a great printer and scanner. the HP smart app takes forever to load. half the time I need to clear cache and Uninstalled and reinstall and log in online for it or work properly. the intention is great. when it works it's great. the problem is getting it to work. not reliable.",
      "Im not sure if its the apps fault or the printer itself, regardless, its a pain in the neck to use. Was extremely difficult to set up for some reason, had to be on the phone with support for a half hour or more. Even then, it still has issues connecting to the network, when all other devices in home connect seamlessly. Id go for a different company for printers."

Error codes, I follow all steps of reboots and change equipment but still remain. I have mobile as well, overall pretty good. Could be my phone , but at times, I lose service. Honestly, I think they should give you a package to pick what you want. They add $2.95 a month for a sport's channel, something I do not want.",
      "I wish I could give a negative number but can only do 1 star, Xfinity has really dropped the ball on the phone app you use to be able to change passwords, names, add items to your wifi, now you can't do anything, you can't even pay the bill, most of the time the app doesn't even work, and when you call in the tech isn't trained very well, and I end up helping them, it's terrible.",
      "Just horrible. Absolutely the worst app. It is very slow, unresponsive, changes fail to save after taking several minutes. Help is a blank page. It WILL make sure your bill gets paid though... even though there is never any compensation for the constant service outages. It's just awful. I think I'll change internet service providers because this thing is complete garbage. UPDATE: Continues to be garbage! After logging in four or five times in still going in circles trying to pay my bill! ARG!",
      "We are consistently having problems with our cable lately -- programs freezing, getting error messages and being booted from recordings, playback issues with recordings, randomly re-setting, etc. It is SO frustrating and you can never reach someone easily! Our bill keeps going up, but the service gets worse! I'm just about done with Xfinity! If I could, I would give ZERO stars!",
      "I don't know how long there's been an issue with the app. As of today, the feature to assign, pause and put my PC to sleep is missing. I set it to block internet after a certain time so my kids can't sneak on while I'm asleep. Well I'm using it and it stops. Takes me a minute to realize i set it that way. I go to the app to wake it up and I haven't managed to do it yet. Googled for help and says to go under the Wi-Fi tab. There's no Wi-Fi tab. Just overview, services and account. So frustrating."

Please note that the information provided is based on the knowledge cutoff of September 2021 and may be outdated. Additionally, the app currently lacks voice commands func",
      "Outstanding! Wow. What an awesome app. I asked for twelve multiple choice questions on a God theme for a church Quiz that I run every month, and for between the ages of 15 - 30 year olds, and Instantly; \"Pow!\" ... It gave me exactly what I had asked, and they 'will' be used on my next quiz to take place on the Sunday, 24th, March, 2024. I will definitely be using CHATBOT AI again. This app is second to none. üòòüëå ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Love it. ‚úÖ",
      "It has no interaction with ones phone, it only offers text based AI in order to speak. You have to copy the item and paste it in text to speak, because it can't do that for you. Waste of money. Find a better affordable ai that can at least talk back and doing something as simple as email a friend.",
      "The functionality is excellent and I get perfect results in each of my search. If there was anything higher than just a five star, I give the app because I feel I under rated it. I will recommend this to anyone I know that is in need of knowledge because this all is loaded and always disposed to help people like me. Thank you the developers, you have done a great job",
      "It's good, but one huge downfall, is the AI Bot doesn't remember past conversations which is a huge shame for me. So over time the Bot doesn't get to know you or familiarise itself with the user. For example if a User adds birthdays for example, the Bot totally forgets on other conversations. Shame because that is what makes Bots good, you can name them, or familiarise the Bot around the end user."

      "Honestly,I love this app. . I just find it odd that sometimes it says 2000 characters , other times it says 4,000 and sometimes it gives me the option to be precise, casual, or professional, whereas the other times it does not. Why?? I get a little to wordy when I'm writing but this app makes it more concise; since I am a Microsoft 365 customer, I also get help for writing errors as well as other items that the free option does not have for example, in Microsoft Edge and Word, so it's great",
      "I don't know what Microsoft was doing when they made their own phones but once again, they designed an Android app that is the best in its class. It is a very useful piece of AI and does a very good job at responding both verbally and by text. It can be slightly slower than some of the rest because it also uses the internet to reference information. Keeping that in mind, you won't find a better AI experience on Android (I've checked). This should have been Cortana.",
      "great app... I am looking forward to future updates though. there are definitely some bugs to work out as far as restricted content or verbiage goes. it would als9 be nice if I could go back to previous generated images to work on them further as well. o ly other thing would be the ability to create clips or reels... otherwise it's an amazing app... the only one I actually pay for tbh",
      "I loved this app at first. I was able to do a lot of research and the image generation worked great. The past week, the app keeps freezing up when generating images. Especially when you go to view the image or try to download it. It's made me not want to use it because it becomes too stressful with the constant freezing.",
      "Copilot is the best AI on the market and it's not even close. I really wanted to like Google Gemini, but I've been comparing both when I do research or how to, and Copilot is just next level, way ahead. Copilot is the way to go for now and from a very long time because it's just getting better. Don't settle for less. Get the best in the market."

      "This app has been declining for a few months. I've been having the same glitches as everyone else, like weird autocorrect and capitalization. The new update is not good. Let us choose whatever size we want for our fonts. Why does it only go down to 8, and why can't we enter them manually? Additionally, I've been having a glitch that says that someone else is on the document I'm currently editing even when it's not shared with anyone. It's just annoying.",
      "I've had no choice but to stop using this app. It keeps glitching, turning on caps when I don't want it to, and auto correcting when I don't want it to and not auto correcting when it's obvious that an auto correct is needed. It also pulls the latter paragraph to the current paragraph when it auto corrects a word when I'm editing the current paragraph. Don't get me started on it adding letters to words when I'm backspacing. I'm absolutely tired of this. Third update: Nothing has changed.",
      "I've been experiencing the same issues as many others as far as random capitalizations, cursor jumping to the wrong paragraph, and autocorrecting words that shouldn't be corrected. I've tried clearing my cache and that didn't help. The thing is, this only happens on my Samsung S22 Ultra, but not my old Samsung Note 9 despite both having the latest update. Hopefully this might help you figure out where to look for the bugs in the code if you know it's only affecting newer model devices! Thanks!",
      "Usually it's great and on a computer it works very well, but on mobile, it might be the most atrociously managed and technically trash app I've used. It's very disappointing. I literally type things in a note pad on my phone, so I can copy + paste it over to Docs on mobile just to be able to use it normally on PC. Very unfortunate, the random and fully wrong autocorrect and capitalization makes the app nearly unusable. Quite sad as it's a great idea and used to work excellently. Not worth it now",
      "Convenient platform, buggy app... I love to use docs for my personal projects, and I have been doing so for years. It has worked wonders on desktop; however, for some reason, I experience random capitalization and autocorrecting proper words into.... vomit?? This only occurs on the app version in collaboration with my Samsung keyboard. I have been holding out hope that an update would fix this issue, but it has been nearly 2 months now. Please fix this. I am sincerely heartbroken."

      "I would not recommend this app for QR scanning. When you scan a code instead of popping up with the actual link it pops up with a link to scam websites. It's only if you look around the edge of your screen do you see the tiny subscript \"ad\" message. Do yourself a favor and get an app that if it does have ads, they aren't acting like the code you scanned",
      "A little odd after it was installed. A page popped up to install a QR reader/scanner and I had just done that. I hit the back arrow and got another weird page. So I closed the app, found the icon and started over. A little problem in a dimly lit room but the app has a button to tune the light on. Moved the phone a little bit and it immediately came up with the URL. The original QR scanner worked sporadically and I had deleted it before installing this app. Great extras in this app.",
      "Downloaded this app to set up a TV. It even showed a set up page, as soon as I put in card info ( tv even said it would give a free trial but need card information on file) my bank account got hit with all kinds of random charges. Double checked to make sure I didn't accidently hit an ad and I hadn't. Lost money and had to have my bank account shut down due to this. Save your time, frustration and money and don't use it. It hacks your account and does all kinds of bogus charges!",
      "Still dont work ! Definitely an uninstall. Even updates havent improved the functionality, Good luck developers, seems like this has been kind of a lemon for ya. Could be my devices or internet but ive tried a few times over a year or longer and if it works, it should be WAY easier to navigate. All it does is run the line back and forth thru the barcode scanner frame but wont scan no matter what. Could be doing it wrong ? If so please set me up with directions, and accept my most humble apology.",
      "Undecided about this app. As soon as I installed and scanned I got a pop up asking for my credit card details. I thought I needed to establish identity for a \"free \" account. Found out I will get charged over $30 in 5 days. I don't think the ad is part of the app but it's a very deceptive way of getting people to subscribe to something else. If the developer dose not want to be \"painted with the same brush\" maybe they shouldn't allow these ads."

      "Excellent App. I've scanned many barcodes with quick, excellent recognition.(tiny, damaged, low contrast, etc.) Of course some of this can be dependent on your phone's capabilities. Ads: There is a small ad strip at the bottom of the screen less than finger's width. Not intrusive or confusing at all. Small popup asks you to rate the app. Press \"later\" use the app, then rate it at some point. easy. Results: Options to use Google, Amazon, etc. for results. Info results are as good as what is available on the web. Access to your camera and the ability to retrieve results from the web are the ONLY permissions that have been requested by the app. Confusion: MANY of the negative reviews here are based on a different developer's app. This is an excellent app. If I used this kind of utility more often, I'd buy the pro version without hesitation.",
      "With the Pandemic restaurants are slowly reopening. They are unable to pass out old menus. Many places are printing copies & handing them out. The barcode allows a restaurant to have the menu come up on a smartphone. It's simple to install. The app uses the phones camera to take a picture. It's then becomes a .pdf file which can be saved & relabled with the restaurants name. I then created a folder \"Restaurant Menu's\". I can now order takeout from home & pick it up or use a delivery service.",
      "I just downloaded the app tried to use it once and already popping up to upgrade to the paying version and I declined. When I scanned the QR code I need to find out about because it's from the post office about a letter I'm waiting for, it scans the code and nothing else. Can't click on it, won't open to a new web browser, in fact it does absolutely nothing at all!! Waste of time and all they want you to do is upgrade to the paid version in order for the scanner to properly work!!üëéüëéüëé",
      "works, but takes a while. at first it isn't clear whether it's currently looking for a QR code or whether I need to do something to trigger it, I tweaked the scan box several times and opened and closed the settings menu before it finally recognized the code. This is when lighting and focus were pretty good. But this scanner eventually succeeds where other scanners fail.",
      "After downloading this app, I spent time using the features it offers and I was actually very surprised that it exceeded all of the great reviews it has gotten! I was so skeptical of all the excellent reviews that were so equally complimentary, that I was somehow morphing into a conspiracy theorist! After I spent the time trying to prove it was a marketing set-up, I happily felt like a fool, because they were correct with this one!! It is truly awesome compared to any other one I've used!"

      "I like it, except the app doesn't finish reading out loud long emails. The app keeps saying I need a page to read that and then shuts down. I have to make the time to physically read the long email that I was using the app for to save some time. I liked back when the app allowed you to look at the document as it was being read. It made it easier to take notes. Anyway, for reading short emails, it works fine, but it fails to completely finish reading out loud long emails.",
      "At first I was not too happy when my MSN email was switched to outlook but after trying it out, I now Love it. Outlook separates your email into two major categories: Focused & Others. In addition to Junk. You have the options of selecting which messages are most important and the least significant. You have full control of all of your messages. Easy as pie to use.",
      "Remove Bing Search from Context menu. Then I'll come back. I love Outlook but not if you're going to integrate yourself into my Android. 2/13/14 wow. This app has evolved in the past 2 years easier to use than the PC app, Mac version is better but not by much. Upgraded to 3 stars from 1. Refresh rates are glitchy slow to push on Android. Also doesn't always refresh \"live\" even when trying to sync from iPhone or PC to android.",
      "CAUTION TO OTHER USERS: Not fully syncing emails. I'e been waiting for an email for the past few days and have monitoried my app. The sender resent it several times, yet it is not showing up on my outlook app. Finally, i checked via PC & there they are. During that time I received other emails which on time. After identifying the discrepancy, I attempted to sync the email. I found no option for that. As a result, I now know this app is not as reliable.",
      "Good in some ways but, like so many Microsoft products, it's an anti-productivity tool in others. If you want to go through and delete a bunch of emails at one time you have to oh-so-carefully touch the circle on the side of each one. If you are off by a little bit it opens the email for you or, worse, it unselects everything you've just selected. It is certain that the redundant, fat-salary earners at M-soft who design and produce their products don't use them."

      "How in the world can such a conceptually simple and ancient app lack so many basic features? Can't add custom colors. Can't set it so back doesn't accidentally close a sheet. Images aren't cached. Rearranging sheet order is ridiculously slow. Can't access justify or borders unless in landscape mode. References to cells in other sheets must be done manually. Worst part is that on android, this app is still vastly superior to the web app on both chrome and Firefox based browsers.",
      "It blows my mind that such a rich company can't provide an app with basic functions. First off, this app crashes and or gets held up when entering data. I'll often need to reenter data updates. The undo feature apparently can undo its self enough to close the app. Upon reopening all data entry is lost. I'm running the pixel 7 with high speed internet and great cellular signal. I'm sure the developer will have some excuse. Years of using this app and its never improved. Google need to listen",
      "would be great if it didn't randomly set my shared documents **that I myself created** to view only, thus preventing me from making any further edits. would also be great if i could fix this from mobile, as i have no pc, and it says it can only be changed with pc. furthermore, i find that strange, since the only person i have shared one particular document with also has no pc. so overnight it mysteriously randomly set itself to view only. thanks google. (sarcasm.) it does this with docs too.",
      "I am constantly having issues where Google Sheets goes into view only mode. It'll only happen on certain spreadsheets. I can edit them on desktop so it seems to be an issue with the app. Needing to make edits quickly on mobile and not being able to is extremely frustrating. I have Google One and I'm thinking of switching to a different suite of services altogether because it's really unacceptable now unreliable it is.",
      "I love this app and use it constantly. It would get five stars, except for one thing. You cannot create named ranges, which I would use constantly, if I could. I've tried emailing about it, and get a message saying that the address is no longer being monitored. I'm honestly annoyed. This is the best spreadsheet app I know, but the exclusion of this already-existing feature is seriously hampering my workflow. So I'm making some noise here with the hopes of catching someone's attention."

      "Much faster than adobe when looking a blueprints (pdf's) via android phone or tablet, but is easily overloaded and can \"potentially\" crash often. Has a few bugs when highlighting pdf's and not Being able to view the highlights unless opening documents in another app. But it's still more efficient than Adobe when just viewing via tablet or phone.",
      "Slow to open documents/pdfs..etc. Sometimes, I open a document, and the app doesn't open it. Instead, after a loading screen, it takes me to the recent docs tab, overall sluggish and slow. The experience isn't great, I expected better from microsoft. I hope you remove the annoying loading screen and take me directly to the file i opened without hitches.",
      "Samsung Note 20: it is a wonderful app. Reviewers say you can not move files to other folders. Yes, you can. Open the file, click the three dots, and choose Save As. Now you can choose the location you want to save the file to. A complaint is Outlook Calendar. Search displays data back six months only. To see data older than six months, I use Samsung Calendar. It uses the same data as Outlook does, yet displays data from years ago. On PC Outlook, Search performs as expected.",
      "On the one hand it's convenient to have access to Word documents and Excel worksheets on the phone; on the other hand, the app is pretty limited in function, which is frustrating when you're used to the full functionality (e.g. if there's a way to apply (or even view) conditional formatting in Excel in the app, I haven't found it...). PLEASE get rid of the \"try scanning\" pop-up that interferes with opening documents.",
      "If you'd like an app that allows you to use it in order to get your daily work done.. i'd recommend Adobe acrobat! Works way better than this hot garbage and let's you select more than one file at a time. You'd think with all that money that Microsoft could make a better PDF editing app. Guess not."

      "I'm just not impressed. The app could be much more user-friendly but instead makes it very difficult to use in some areas, especially access sharing and security. The file structure is also a bit wonky. The paid storage is way too expensive! There should be more options available so you don't have to make the leap from free to $200 a year! That's ridiculous! Dropbox has been around for years and I expect more from this company, but they have simply failed to deliver!",
      "This app was pretty good at its job for a long time, but in the past couple weeks it's suddenly gone very downhill. Files upload to the wrong folder and refuse to be moved, downloads are hit-or-miss, and the new visuals take up way too much space on the screen. If the uploads and downloads aren't sorted soon, I will be looking for an alternative.",
      "Today is March 4. Since March 1, Dropbox on my Samsung phone has been very difficult to use. On March 1, I opened it and the files appeared different. Pathways have changed. Photos appear and disappear from their frames. When I gather some photos for transfer to another folder, get asked TO WHICH FOLDER?, choose the 'transfer to' folder... and then Dropbox disappears! I reopen it and have to start over, again and again. Do I need to change something? Dropbox worked great until 2/29.",
      "Use this app almost everyday, it isneasy and definitely comes in handy. Because I can share pictures with anybody. Or I can build an album and give them the link for them. Open pictures and view them themselves. In the best part, no memory sticks to lose. No, I forgot my memory stick at home, or the dreaded my memory stick just failed. Recommend for anyone who stores a lot of pictures, or documents.",
      "I have a 2TB account at Dropbox. They don't have any options to let you transfer your data or pictures over to another provider (i.e. drive). You have to manually do it which essentially makes it very hard to leave them. I want to migrate my data over to drive as they software for managing pictures is so much better and with Google photos you can easily search by name of people linked in your contacts. After 8 years with Dropbox I leaving, once I migrate (manually) to better services platform!"

      "Wants to replace Assistant, but can't perform simple tasks. Can't do much as set a reminder with it, uninstalled within a minute of installing it. A great example of putting the cart before the horse. EDIT 03/03/2024: this functionality was present for a bit but now it's gone again. I'd given it 3 stars when it was working, but back to 1 star since it's now missing. Google really needs to get it's Assistant replacement to work as an assistant.",
      "** update** So it works pretty good and I'm assuming it depends on your phone as well. I'm running it on Samsung Galaxy s21 Ultra. It does do the simple tasks like schedule reminders and alarms. It can open apps and search for video. It can easily plan a trip find all the cheapest flights and you just have to book it. I've noticed it doesn't always work and it looks like it switches between Google assistant and Gemini like two separate apps they quickly combined so I'm sure it will get better.",
      "The app has become unresponsive and even the support email is no longer in service. How does this happen? The app had been working for a while. For those complaining about Gemini taking over assistant, that can be changed in the settings. I do agree Google should not have allowed that change without notifying users. The strange thing is now the app won't even load. I have cleared cache, storage, and even reinstalled the app. All I get is a blank black screen.",
      "Really bad interface. To use it for anything it tells you to go to the app and change settings. But doesn't link or open it. Then when you attempt to change the setting, it gives instructions to go into another, different app to change other settings. All to set a reminder which apparently now I can't do anymore. How could they not test the most basic functionality??! I thought our best and brightest were at Google...",
      "Understanding it's a experimental replacement for assistant. It still can't do as much as assistant can such as playing audio from an app. Additionally, although settings say it will use your location, it doesn't such as asking what the weather is gives weather for the incorrect location. It would also be nice if it read out loud the response automatically if the request was done via voice. If the request was done via voice, it may indicate the user needs to be hands-free."

      "This is a great app. I recommend it to everyone. It does exactly what it claims and it is actually free to use. There has been no interruptions from ads during any of the interactions with Norton Genie. It does not constantly interrupt the interactions with ads to upgrade Norton Genie to the \"premium\" version and it does not have you copy, paste, and submit the email/message text, links, photo to the app, only to reply, \"scanning for scams is accessible with the paid premium version only.\"",
      "I like where this is going but would like to see these features integrated into Norton 360. It should scan email, messages, images without the user having to copy paste or touch them. Copy pasting from email or messages increases the risk of accidentally clicking malicious links or images that lead to malicious websites or tracking images.",
      "Too cumbersome and time-consuming. I for one do not have time to showing you stuff. If you can't block it what good is it. And quite frankly after 30 years with Norton and you charging for things you keep adding is going to turn off a lot of customers. I was led to believe Norton 360 was all I would ever need. But Norton keeps adding expensive add ons'.",
      "It might help people who can't recognize reasonably obvious scam clues, but what it needs is the ability to recognise well designed spam. In particular, it would be a lot more useful if I could upload a full email -- the message text plus the headers -- so that the app could detect when an email was sent from an address other than the one shown as the From. I had one today purportedly from a friend in trouble. But was it really from them or from a scammer wanting me to reply? I can't tell!",
      "so,as I got familiar with genie Norton, I noticed that the more I interacted with it, the better it got. Plus, from what I gather, this app isn't malicious in any kind of way. so if you're a Terminator fan, don't worry, I believe this to be a very informative an influential piece of data."
