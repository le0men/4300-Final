      "This app was a great app, until I bought something a couple months ago. I've bought things in the past from shein, so I was just expecting a normal arrival. But since I've ordered it in November--(it's currently March), I haven't received it. I thought the package may have gotten lost because it said it was on transit, but then the same thing happened in January, and I still haven't gotten that package either. Im not able to get a refund because it's been so long. I want my 30$ back.",
      "I have been scammed 2 times! One was with a lip tint which is ok it was cheap but then another time was one that I needed like now! And it could not even come! I might delete the app even though l have gotten some good stuff from them! This is just Dissapointing!!!!! I want my stuff! I paid my money and never got a refund at all! I'm super disappointed and I expected better then this",
      "The app has a daily check-in where you can collect and earn points to redeem on purchases. I don't know when the update happened, but I've noticed that my points have been lowering instead of rising. They added a thing where the points expire and it is ridiculous! I do not order often, but I do order! I wish it would go back to how it was before!",
      "Items are pretty good, true to size. However, the recent courier choice for Dubai is a let down. Lazy... Don't want to travel where I live. So I find an alternate address. Aggressive... Shout at me frustration because they can't listen. Arrogant... Traveling without GPS locations and telling me where I went wrong when my instructions are clear to other delivery companies and they never had a problem.",
      "It's the worst app i have ever used. Cannot be trusted. Recently made a purchase and returned a few items and received an incorrect refund for the I have spent over a month trying to explain & get a correct refund. I opened an enquiry, and they closed it without even resolving it than i had to open another enquiry and repeat myself over & over again. If it was $1 i would have let it go but they owe me around $63. Most untrusted."

      "Enter Coupon in temu profile for $100. As an american, I love temu! It's fun, there's a lot of categories you can choose, and it always keeps me entertained. Since I play it a lot, I have noticed some issues lately, however. For example, I'm not sure if it's just my device, but I have been experiencing delays when I swipe, like it either takes longer than expected to move when I swipe or it just doesn't work. Other than that, I definitely recommend this game! Just hope the issue gets fixed soon.",
      "Enter Coupon in temu profile to get $100. Good! This app is so wonderful. However I do have a few problems. 1. When I play with my stylus, the game will sometimes not move and I will die. 2. There are too many ads. There is one every time after I die. Even when I say no to watch an and ad to revive myself, it still shows me an ad anyway. 3. Sometimes when I try to exit an ad, it takes me to the play store or website of the ad. This game needs some fixes but other than that, it's pretty good.",
      "Enter Coupon in temu profile section to get $100. It's top on affordable items online store to access, but it's really chintzy with coin payouts. It gets very \"expensive\" to play each round and even when you win, you don't always recoup the base cost (you never recoup the costs if you choose to \"buy\" extras). I appreciate that they want people to spend real money, but clearing a level should at least consistently get your \"buy in\" back. You just hit a point where each round costs too many coins.",
      "Enter Coupon in temu profile for $100. The temu is ok. It gets smooth as you use. They give offers so I would recommend saving those. My issue is the side apps from the main game. You will never beat it or get anywhere near close to finishing it because of the insane amount of energy you need to clear the land to complete the task. The same with the merge games. The overly redundant times you need to merge the items to get what you need is insane. You can just do it for fun, never completion.",
      "It is a decent site. The deliveries are fast and most of the time the packages arrive undamaged. HOWEVER, the app is awful. Every page has a spinning wheel and takes up so much time I get frustrated, close the app and go over to Aliexpress. STOP wasting our time. We are already on your app, stop slowing people down from shopping. If you just quit trying to force a discount on us and just give the discount, people would get more stuff. Just stop."

      "app is still a bit difficult to navigate, I was attempting to make a purchase on the app. I had items in my cart for purchase. So then I apparently opened up Walmart online through my browser. I was switching back and forth from the app and the site and had two different cart contents. I almost paid for the wrong cart, glad I didn't but still, there should be a way to link your accounts, through the app and the site as long as you are signed in to your profile... Just saying",
      "The Wal-Mart app is good for the most part, but one bug that I found is when I try to select substitutions. When I search for a similar item it kicks me out of the substitute section, and I have to start over. I noticed it does that even after I hit the select button for a substitution. I had to select the done button after each item or it wouldn't save. Also, when selecting substitutions, it doesn't show all available options for a product that I just saw when I was adding items to my cart.",
      "I always compare prices from Amazon and Walmart. Walmart is becoming more and more competitive every time. If the prices are the same, I ALWAYS purchase from Walmart because I hate Amazon and would love to never use it again. The cost savings of using it almost make life without it impossible due to limited income. Walmart's app is becoming easier and easier to use and had very nice features, like add multiple to the cart with a single tap. Keep it up Walmart!",
      "Terrible! Terrible! Terrible! This is the second month in a row the app has glitched out this time costing me $188.31. It goes to blank screen and you think that the oder wasn't placed; it doesn't show up in your shopping cart. So When I added it to another order it show up in the original order. Canceled immediately and they shipped it anyway even though their representative said it was taken care of. Ended up with two of the same order.",
      "I value the app. Some functions are lacking. The sort by price only somewhat sorts so I feel I need to check the entire list to make sure I am getting the lowest price. The pricing also bizarre. You will have an item priced for $15 and the exact same item listed for $35 with neither item on sale. I can't seem to easily move saved favorites to different lists and recently the option to select alternatives at checkout isn't available. Thank you"

      "The whole experience of using the app if fine and much better than the web interface. Coin collection is a nice feature. Search customizations are not adequate and too many things to click on. Sometimes not enough spec on the product while they are available on other platforms. The app should be streamlined in a better way. One thing I hated the most is the ad or notification that pop up when you open the app. Over all, would you use it again and continue purchasing from Ali Express.",
      "Everything I have ordered has came as described. Be careful of pricing, some things are showing photos of larger items with low prices. For example: Click on a large tent that is listed as $12 dollars and find out that is the price for the tent stakes ONLY. THEN once you have been drawn in the price of the actual TENT will be .....say...$260. If your looking for cheaper options for some items this would be my go to app. I have ordered over a dozen items. Shipping could take weeks.",
      "Our experience is merchant after merchant...that fails to deliver. They use various tactics to lying about shipping info, reroute shipments, screw up tracking numbers, report after a week they don't have inventory, and more. Illegal listings, where they show a main image, describe it accurately in the title, and show a price. BUT go into listing to buy or put in cart and they suddenly show other items to pick from, where the other items are the price listed and jack up the price on main item.",
      "Mobile app is easier to use than the desktop version, because the site opens a window for every product you view, which makes it difficult to navigate. As for the shop, I've purchased several items, and shipping can vary from early, on time and late. I've select products from seller's that have detailed product information as well as plenty of details about the company.",
      "App is just the website: usually misleading, different prices than the item shown. Items not packed, just thrown in a baggie, so most items arrive damaged. That is, if it arrives at all. Ali requires proof that an item was not delivered. After many attempts, they asked I provide a letter on official stationary from the carrier. Local tracking only refers you to the Chinese sender which has no customer service access. So even though items are cheap, you don't always get what you paid for."

      "There's no way in the app reasonably to leave feedback. Amazon is very hard to contact. The app does not sort products by price or any other reasonable way that one would normally sort lists of things. You can select things by price range or by company but I just want to sort things from cheapest to most expensive and that is not an option in Amazon shopping that I can find.",
      "I used to enjoy the app, had no issues, and used it often. I liked the app much better than their website, but now the app is unusable. It freezes/crashes every single time. If I go to look at product pictures or reviews, guaranteed freeze. If you can't look at items to purchase, check reviews, or browse more than 2 minutes, the app is pretty much useless.",
      "I use it all the time, I generally like it, and i built amazon into my routines, I have to give this review because they do not bill the default card on my account. they bill what appears to be the newest card on the list. This has resulted in much heart ache because the cards were there for very specific classes of purchases, I have to keep stuff separate. this results in extra fees and pain. I've called and chatted, no fix. will go back to 4 star likely when fixed. because it takes so long",
      "This app takes forever to load and change screens. It pushes subscriptions too much. Impossible to re-find a product. It is great for the people who want groceries delivered and/or use the subscription option. Plan on jumping through 3 or more hoops if you need to contact them. But they have free shipping most of the time.",
      "They never follow delivery instructions. Your card gets charged at random times and not right away after placing an order. I've had Amazon take money out for orders weeks after I got them because they never charged me for them. Prime video is a mess. It's $3 extra a month to watch without ads and that's a limited selection. You need multiple subscriptions and to purchase shows and movies. If you order any food / drinks and it gets damaged, you won't get a replacement."

      "Very bad and invasive app. I just wanted to search for a product on the website and it kept pushing me to the app like 30 times in 5 minutes. When I finally gave up and installed it, it kept trying to make me sign up and take my information before I even could look at anything. In the end it was buggy and images were overlapping, etc. Just not worthy - Alibaba will never be even close to A****n! Uninstalled.",
      "The items are great, but when I click on one of the variation options and add enough that I more than satisfy the minimum requirement, then press the \"Send inquiry\" button. it just shows a black screen and I have to can't send an inquiry after adding over the minimum quantity. I can get back via phones back button, but can't buy anything. Please assist. I'm on a Pixel 7 Pro running Android 14. Thanks!",
      "Search option is pretty bad because it doesn't understand what you're typing. But really, it spammed me with pop-ups and kept freezing the app with a notification that I needed to close the app to update it. I checked the store and it's updated so it's a bug. Can't find anything that is related to what I typed + freezes every 15 seconds (I'm not joking)= uninstall.",
      "You'll be amazed. . The variety of products, the crazy prices, the well executed seller (often factory) sites, it all makes for great window shopping if nothing else. And you don't have to buy bulk on everything any more to get a great price either. Shipping is still the catch. But if you are willing to wait or can spread the shipping with quantity.. Have fun",
      "It's just a little hard finding things you want. What I may think it will be and what they will have interpreted to say for sale are two different things App works very smoothly. No problems with it on my droid phone and it updates just fine. Installed 3 different phones & office computer. On my phone for over a year. Makes researching new products and styles very easy. Cuts out the middleman. Too much to look at. LOL"

      "The Target app is my go-to for convenient shopping on-the-go. It's user-friendly interface and intuitive navigation make browsing and purchasing a breeze. The Target Circle rewards program offers great discounts and savings. However, occasional glitches and slow loading times can be frustrating. Improvements in app stability and performance would elevate the user experience. Despite these issues, it remains an essential tool for managing my shopping needs.",
      "Search feature is absolutely broken. It doesn't give you what you are searching for half the time, and when it does, the first half of the results are usually unrelated garbage. The filters don't work, and it will show you what you filtered out anyways. It won't show you search results often times if you aren't specific enough. For example I searched for t shirts, and was told no results found. I searched for mens t shirts, and it suddenly found 800 results.",
      "Would do 0 stars but not an option. App itself is great for finding items in store, but god forbid you try to order anything for delivery. Twice I've tried and had original orders canceled and replaced with iPad. Both times I've had to call both Target and shipt telling them I never authorized replacement or purchase of iPad. Oh and the hours of phone time where it's not Targets fault that I got charged for an item I didn't authorize because shipt driver can decide to change order and charge me.",
      "Update: Okay, now I can't even select a store or enter a zip code without an error. Jrjfjfkfkf. The app was great but has increasingly gotten worse with each new update. I rely heavily on this app daily. Yesterday, I took it to the store and had to force close the app every single time I scanned an item, just because it would freeze up. The bugs have significantly increased how long I'm at the store. It's frustrating to use now, unfortunately, and the app is primarily how I used to shop.",
      "Very useful and feature rich app, but lacks notifications channel. Android has this beautiful feature to set different notifications preferences for different types of notifications from same app. I'd want my \"ready for pickup\" notification to be loud whereas deals & offers in silent and can catch up later. But Target app doesn't provide this capability."

    "recentChanges": "Going somewhere fun? Take us with you, right on your phone! That way, you&#39;ll never miss a new item or a flash sale from that small shop you&#39;re low-key obsessing over. You know the one – that great seller who answers every question with a smile. And, they always write a sweet note for you to find when you open your beautifully wrapped order. Take care and talk soon, friend!",
    "comments": [
      "The fact that there is not a way to download digital purchases from the app is absolutely ridiculous. The app interface is okay, though there are plenty of rough spots. Finding a full list of things you've saved can be tricky and annoying. Navigating through a sellers catalog is also tedious, but it could be worse. Esthetically, the app is lovely. I just wish it were backed up by better functionality.",
      "I used to love this app, but now it won't even let me log in on the phone app or on my computer. I just keep getting an error message stating \"too many requests\". I've cleared the cache and storage in the app, I've restarted my phone, and even uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but it still doesn't work. It's very frustrating!",
      "You know very well there isn't a method to contact support for app issues on your site. This isn't about my account, this is about the way your app is developed. There are certain push notifications I do and don't want, but I don't have the option to choose - trying to toggle any one type of notification takes you to Android OS' notification settings for the app, forcing you into an all or nothing agreement. Either you accept their ads and annoying useless messages, or you get no updates at all.",
      "Trustworthy company with many protections for the consumer. I am never worried about purchasing from Etsy, and I think it is a great way to support small businesses from all across the world! However, the recent updates to the mobile update makes it confusing to navigate. I preferred when there was a separate tab for my favorites, and it just showed me my lists instead of a continuous \"there's only one left of this item!\" I think a whole tab just for gift cards is wholly unnecessary.",
      "I used to love shopping on Etsy. Browsing for hours through all of the wonderful goodies. But the app and site have become so messy that it's too overwhelming to use. They have made literally everything a big image which is overstimulating and nowhere is there a place to change the view to a simple list or even smaller images. There's way too much going on and to contact them it's pretty impossible. I won't be using Etsy anymore until they clean it up."

      "The eBay app is a good alternative to the desktop/laptop version, in a few ways. For one, there are notifications and special coupons for using it. Also, the essential categories and settings in the site are prioritized for mobile devices. Also, there is less RAM used than a desktop/laptop, which helps maintain the bare minimum for an online application.",
      "I don't think I've had a bad experience with buying on ebay. I only wish i used this site for all my sales. Other than that, even with returns for something that came wrong, different than pictures, broken, or I changed my mind, I've never had an issue with any seller. Nor needed ebay's help to back me up on a return. Sellers have all been great, happy buyer, soon to be seller.",
      "Great app: needs improvements. 1. There seems to be a bug with item listing from saved sellers store's which are out of stock showing up as if they were not yet sold out. 2. I think more customization options added to seller profile pages such as status message separate to that of the seller's bio. It's gets annoying over time a when trying to track specific items from saved sellers stores, there's limited native options for, third party websites pick up where eBay saved searches lacks.",
      "Love eBay!! If you want something that is usually expensive, check eBay before buying it, cuz 99% of the time it's there & it's cheaper! Things are available Brand New, Open Box, Used or bid on an item it's up to you. Who doesn't like to save money?!? I know I do! I also sell items on there & you can too, it's pretty easy. You can just scan the bar code & everything about it pops up, or u can enter the info. You can even see what the going rate is! I'm telling you, check out eBay it's worth it.",
      "Absolutely awful no matter what I do gift card, debit, credit, PayPal, etc. They will not accept any money at all. I've contacted them and they totally brushed me off, told me to wait 24 hours and ended the conversation. Now they say it's my bank contacted the bank nope they say that ebay is ending the transaction and issuing a refund. DO NOT AUCTION ON THIS SITE. once upon a time it was good but not anymore!"

    "comments": [
      "I'll give 5 stars since I've been a loyal user making lots of profit through this awesome app. There is just one major thing that I'd want offerup to add and that is the feature to cancel shipments and offers instead of having to wait days for it to automatically expire. That is by far the only thing I'd love for you guys to fix other than that this is the best place to form a selling business!",
      "The app is good however it's frustrating when you're looking for something and it's been posted years ago, not sure if you have any control of removing things that are old but would be nice if there was a sort option for newly posted. Update: Shows old postings that are no longer available shows postings from about 6 years ago and postings not even within the miles I've set",
      "Their website needs some work. Messaging and browsing is great. However, it would be much easier if we can post or edit listings from there. Especially since the app can be so laggy and slow. I'd also like to have the ability to send pictures via messages. Sometimes buyers would like to see more pictures of the item. Or something specific about the item. The only options are to post more pictures, which require to edit the entire listing, or take the conversation off the app.",
      "I really do like OfferUp. I've sold and bought quite a bit from here. My complaint is that every single time I open the app, I have to click *Local so I don't see the items that can be shipped. I have to do this EVERY TIME! iIt's annoying because the items that can be shipped take up the space of items that are local that I'm looking for.. Also, if I look up an item, let's say RVs, it will then display RVs for all eternity. Even though I no longer am ínter in them. That's annoying as well.",
      "I like that there is a reputation system unlike Craigslist, it helps weed out the flakes and lowballers a little. Prices are not displayed on search result thumbnails like Craigslist has, however. You have to go into each item individually to see the price. A lot of ads in search results, often not even relevant. Search results require a lot of sorting. I bought something from a seller who shipped the item and I have no way of rating them! No way to just block someone you have to report them too"

      "The app is broken again and doesn't open. Just sits there with the circular arrow spinning. Seems like this happens about once a month and then an update comes out and it works for a few weeks and then it's back to not opening again. Menards app just always works and opens quickly. Lowes, you need to get this resolved once and for all.",
      "I never write app reviews. Making an exception for this. App has been broken for a week or two now. Search works maybe 1 out of 10 times. Eventually it thinks it has no network connection and stops working completely. The latest update has not fixed the issue. Really disappointing that a huge company like Lowe's has let such a major bug fester in production for so long.",
      "This app is trash. Constantly loses connection or freezes. Links from email auto open in the app, but the app never loads the link you click on and just shows a spinning circle. Filters reset constantly when searching for items in the app. Previous purchases are hard to search and sometimes items are missing/incomplete. Better to stick to just using the web.",
      "UPDATED: I updated to the new version this morning, I checked for a new version last night before I wrote the original review. Thanks so much for the quick response and fix! It's back to working! (original post) >The last update was awful. Can't do a search at all... Just glitches with the blue circle. I used the app a few days before the update and it was great. Now I have to go to the web version just to do a search.",
      "Recent update has made this app useless. It says it can't find an internet connect. I've halted the app, cleared the cache, updated it and it's still stuck. When I try to do a search, it refuses to let me type and tries to force in search suggests of its own. It makes it COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE to use!! Fix this thing or I'll be doing all my shopping at Home Depot,"

      "I used to love this app. Now, it's mostly useless to me (I use Route instead). I went to check it today, and at least 10 non-Amazon orders that were all delivered over a week ago were still marked as in transit! Even with packages that are still in transit, it shows days behind the tracking on the carrier's site and my other tracking app. Plus, Amazon NEVER works! Every time I open the app, I have to reconnect Amazon. Even after reconnecting, the orders still won't load properly or at all.",
      "This app has great connectivity to all of my orders confirmed through email, as well as amazon. It's nice to have all the info in a centralized place. HOWEVER, the \"Shop Cash\" you earn while using the app has very short expiration and I've lost out on too many of the benefits in just the last year or so I've been using this app. Rakuten is definitely my preferred app over this because it's far less stressful to use and there are no deadlines on utilizing the benefits. Hope this changes!",
      "The app works much better lately, however, I've been having trouble with something. Sometimes one of my orders will ship in 2 shipments, with one being delivered before the other, marking the entire order as delivered in my list. I try to manually track the second order, but it says I'm already tracking it. I recently figured out where to see both tracking numbers, however, there is no way to mark the order as only partially delivered. It's so complicated to track the 2nd shipment.",
      "It was very organized and helpful. Now my payment plans don't show up. I don't like that there is not a specific spot for them anymore. There are literally no recent dates when I make purchases for payment plans, or when I pay it off. It makes me not want to use it for payment plans anymore. Just shipping updates Update: emailed customer service, other than telling me how to use the app. The way to fix the updates is to click the link myself from my email. This doesn't fix the problem w/the app",
      "App is fine except for one thing. The number one thing about the app is when a package is going to be delivered, the picture goes from the product you ordered to a package and won't tell you what it who the seller is and becomes a pain when you have multiple packages and you get notified something was delivered but you don't know what. The notifications are super delayed, so it makes keeping track harder than need be. Just don't change the image, and that fix it"

      "Disappointed that Sip & Save is ending.... Otherwise, I'd give 5 stars... Cos I really do love your coffee! Especially the ones from different countries that rotates every few months. I'm probably not alone in thinking that I'd pay a little more for the sip & save if that's what it would take to keep it alive, as I'm assuming it was ended due to it's inprofitibility. I enjoy the games to (hopefully)win instant prizes & CS is always on point in my store.",
      "I don't know when it started happening but I cannot see my home store or the barcode with my ID number on it when I open the app. I have to uninstall and reinstall. And then it only works right after I go through the process and re-enter my phone number. Once I close the app and then try to go back in, the same thing happens. Please fix the bug that is causing this. Then I will change my rating.",
      "I updated this app 12/21/23, right after I reveived a text about the sweepstakes. There is no way to enter in the app... the linked pictures don't work... what seems like there should be a text link does not work. Not the first time I have had trouble; in the past I have had trouble getting coupons... it shows local stores and goes to a map when you click on yours and you can go no further. Had to go to website to enter sweepstakes. Staff at my store could not make sense of, or help with, app.",
      "Great in theory....except nothing EVER rings up with the discount or coupon by just entering your phone number or scanning the app. By the time I've convinced the cashier of the price its supposed to be by scrolling thru the app, they are good and irritated, along with everyone in line behind me. I am hopeful you will work out the Inner Kinks.",
      "It's nice to win prizes, discounts on gas, treats, & beverages, won lots. As for the ticket entries nothing has ever come of those, @least for me & I've won many. 1st part of game is fun-you win prizes. 2nd is inaccurately scored so it's frustrating when you select appropriate items in a row & they aren't counted properly! It makes the game pointless & no longer a challenge if it's not going to be documented.Therefore, a waste of my time! Loved easy pay,but took calling multiple x to get set up!"

    "version": "3.38.1",
    "recentChanges": "This release is just a beautiful bundle of tiny victories. You may notice a smoother navigation to brand pages and a bunch of behind-the-scenes improvements to make your Fetch experience (and life) even better.",
    "comments": [
      "I have been using fetch for over a year now. It was great for a good while, but then deals on receipts weren't being registered. I have to manually add them, except, I never receive the points for those items. Correcting the receipt doesnt actually do anything. I definitely miss the wheel. The games feature takes too long to earn points and installing apps is a hassle, for very little in return. I like being able to just snap a receipt, spon the wheel, get my points and get on with my day. Thx.",
      "It's free money if you were going to buy the items anyway. I preferred when there was a spin feature after each receipt capture. You can get more points playing the games, but I personally am not invested enough to spend more than 10 extra seconds in the app. If you are invested, the games are the way to go. I've gotten $30 in rewards so far by doing absolutely no work except snapping a photo of my receipt. It's so easy.",
      "I like the idea of being able to get gift cards for scanning receipts but they keep going up on how many points it takes to actually get a gift card. That is added to the fact that fetch has a \"spend\" threshold in order to get the extra points that used to be available for buying one or 2 products. I rarely get more than 25 points per receipt anymore. And the games thing added? I have to change my phone settings to play that \"personalizes\" ads. Its a no for me",
      "I love this app. Only thing I've noticed lately is my deal points don't auto register. I have to contact support for them to correct the receipt. Which is effect; I just don't care to always have to contact them to have it corrected. I've also noticed that it doesnt pick up on my reciepts for my Gmail. If you'd have asked me three years ago how I liked this app; I'd have given it 5 stars. But, recently its gone down hill. I hope they fix the bugs",
      "Nice app. Appreciate that this was created. As a software BA, my enhancement suggestions would be: 1. Improve recognition of gas receipts. Tried more than several times to get the app to accept it, and then still had to enter the total manually. (i.e., BJs) 2. When user selects a picture to view the promo item, it is helpful that user sees a slightly zoomed-in image but allow further zoom-in to see the words on the label. There are many products we are not familiar with. (Some of us are older.)"

      "The app hasn't worked well for almost 2 weeks. Products will not load when clicking on recently viewed items or special buys. I can add items to the cart and the number of items on the cart icon rises, but it will not load and instead gives an error screen. I experience no issues visiting the website through the Chrome app. I have cleared cache, app storage, forced stop, uninstalled, and reinstalled...This isn't new, the app often experiences failure & bugs.",
      "I have never been able to log into my account. All I get is a spinning circle, I've tried turning off my Wi-Fi, turning off my VPN, pretty much everything. I download it every once in awhile. hoping there's been an update that fixes this issue, but to no avail. Without being able to log in, I might as well use my phone's web app since it works better. This app has no value or efficient usage. I'd give this zero stars if I could.",
      "Getting to your account & credit card information is wonky at best. I always end up having to use the internet citi bank site to get to the last payment & statements information page. The app is best mainly for making an order or searching for products and even then, the discounts shown aren't always calculated the same as in the store, nor are the prices.",
      "Great place for most of your needs. Friendly staff, always willing to help! But the app sucks... no way to filter for instore items...you have to click on an item to check to see if they have it in store or you have to order it. It would also be great if you could see similar compatible parts if the part you want is not available. I had to change my rating due to frustration 🫤.",
      "Valuable, but imperfect. I use this app every day so I'm a heavy user of it. The biggest issue right now is that often the in-store location (aisle, bay) doesn't show up when it's supposed to. This is frustrating. Also, the price often doesn't show up. It's the space below the product image and above the pickup/delivery option that often fails to display. Otherwise, it's incredibly useful to make a shopping list, access reviews, check order status, check in stock status, etc."

      "It's ok.When I click on an ad and it takes me to the app the actual item from the ad is nowhere to be found.I do like the membership and ease of browsing but their usually out of my size and most of the styles I look up.Also, the outfits on the models/the outfit match up with the shoes could be much better for outfit ideas...Other than that the buying and shipping processes are good.I once bought shoes that were too small and the return process was easy.I also enjoy the customization tool.",
      "It's pretty good it does have it problem when I add items onto the cart and take the items off. It somehow glitches and freezes, so I can not make a transaction. I once had to log out and blog back into my account to make a purchase. I do wish it would let me know if and only when I bought an item and they run out of stock that they let me know before my transaction goes through. Although it's been a long while since that happened, Nike may have fixed this problem.",
      "This app (as with many apps), likes to reformat....often. Those of us that are \"older\" 😬😄 PREFER an easier, streamlined online experience. Sure, the \"old look\" might be \"boring\", but there's an ease-of-use in simplistic terms. I don't like navigating through some site, to try and figure it out. If it gets too confusing, I'm out. No shopping at that point. But it's been mostly alright, so far. I usually only look at running shoes, and maybe occasionally browse.",
      "Overall it's great. You can easily navigate through the app. The only thing they should fix is when you change some of the specific preferences, like changing to only show shoes in a specific size, if you then swipe left from all to Jordan or anything else, then back to all it will reset your preferences so you then have to go back and select specifics again. This can get pretty annoying especially if you swipe left by accident and then have to reset everything and rescroll to where you were.",
      "The scrolling gesture will a lot of times will cause the app to swipe to the right moving to a different category especially when scrolling with your thumb one handed. This wouldn't be too big of an issue if the app kept any filters you had applied active when swiping from one clothing category to the next. Unfortunately it resets filters and sends you all the way back to the top. Pretty frustrating at times especially if you managed to get way down the list."

      "The app is very helpful. I probably look at it once or twice a week. I love the ability to have ordered delivery, order drop off, or pick up options. I like being able to choose a store/location. We probably have been in 8 different stores in 8 year. We love to check out the Sam's club near wherever we may travel. The app location helps us see what is available at that store. I enjoy scan and go too.",
      "I've done pickup orders a number of times and have never had any issues. The entire app worked great until today, when I was unable to \"check-in\" at the store. The \"I'm here\" function would only take me to a blank screen. This was before store opening, so I had to flag down an associate who was bringing out another order - about a 20 minute wait. Now, I'm hesitant to use pickups in the future.",
      "As of the last few months, the ability to use the EBT PIN pad on Scan and Go while in-club fails. I am able to \"slide to pay\" at check out, but when the PIN pad attempts to load, it produces an error message suggesting to update the app. I have updated the app many times, but it still fails. Uninstalling, reinstalling, restaring my phone has all produced no results. Months ago, the PIN pad loaded just fine. For reference, I have a Samsung Galaxy A53 5G. Android OS, of course.",
      "I downloaded the app thinking it would help organize my life and make things simpler but that is a joke. Even when I have the location turned on, it won't allow me to set my club store, the app constantly crashes, nor does it all me to add things to a list that I created. It's simply the worst. Guess I will only be using it as a reminder for when my membership is due for renewal!",
      "Generally love the app, scan and go is very convenient, HOWEVER, rating 2 stars to express my dissatisfaction with the local club delivery service through the app. It is \"batch order processing\" which translates to \"you will never receive the order when you scheduled to receive it and you will not get an updated time of when to expect it.\" Don't offer a service you can't stick to."

      "The app makes it easier to use Affirm at checkout and makes it very easy to make payments on the loans I have with them. The detail section of your purchases and agreements are easily understood with their visual breakdown they give you on the manage page. I'm not one to jump on loans either so this is not a quick sent review. I applied to see if I would have any ability to use them and once I did, I didn't even purchase anything for a few months and then started with something real small.",
      "Best savings app ever!!!! I've been using this free app for over a year. I like that I can schedule automatic deposits into it for however much I want. Their interest APY is insanely good so I'm now receiving more than $10/month just in interest on my own money. As my balance gets larger, so does the interest I'm making. I just set 2 automatic deposits per month and forget about it. Its a wonderful way to build up an emergency fund without feeling stretched with your normal paycheck!",
      "I've been using this for maybe 8 months. No problems with my payments (except for a late payment due to affirms error) They'd even recently raised my limit. Then I paid off two loans early and suddenly I'm not approved to use the service anymore for any amount. I really don't understand and since I use for emergency purchases it's really inconvenient. No one seems to be able to help me figure it out.",
      "I absolutely love the app. I love affirm, period. How cool is it that you can select your loan payments and they will let you switch the due date. It's pretty awesome when you can split the payments instead of paying for it all at once. This is pretty awesome. I even received the affirm credit card. It's absolutely one of my most fav one of credit cards. Usually it's interesting free. I do love this app. I set up auto pay and I never have the be bothered with payments or late payment. Awesome",
      "Been making payments ahead of time, for some reason affirm returns funds back to my bank, i have to make payment again and by that time it says late payment. I called customer service several times and they aren't helpful at all, they have no answer as to why its happening and won't fix it and all this goes to my credit report. Overall every purchase goes smooth. But unfortunately just gonna pay what I owe and close account."

      "This app gets worse with each update. It's easier and faster to just use the website. One example, if you do a search in app, but have to set the phone down for whatever reason... When you go back tk the app it refreshes to the main page and you lose your search results and your place. Filtering is also very hit or miss. What's the point of an app if it's less useful than the website?",
      "The app was always buggy, but overnight there was a major update, and now the app is useless. I have items in my cart from yesterday, but am unable to checkout bc it just keeps spinning and won't load. Same with search. I'm going to uninstall and use my desktop. Also, there has never been a way to find out if an item is in stock at a specific warehouse, and that's the thing we all need.",
      "Love the app but please add a scan & go option like Sam's, and I'd love it even better! 😊 Also, it's annoying that when I look at an item & go back, it doesn't return me to my search results, it takes me all the way back to the beginning & I have to search again. Fix that please.",
      "I believe they made the app purposefully terrible to use to get you into the warehouse. Costco app and website are horrible. Difficult to use. Frequent errors adding items to cart. Out of stock items continually show and you get to cart before it complains with some weird error. I just give up on ordering about half the time. The app resets to home page when your phone screen locks. What a disaster",
      "I don't much understand the purpose of this app if it doesn't allow you to search for products that are in store? Searching for products only shows results that can be delivered, so it's essentially useless for anything that's not an appliance. Like I'm not even asking for it to show me where an item is in the store, I just want to know says your system says you have it. It's just an odd choice. Also please stop the screen from going to maximum brightness when tapping the account button. Pleas"

      "Easy & saves a lot. My only issue is sometimes items won't ring up the same price as on the app. & employees won't always change it to match. Also, different prices & deals for each store. Even in the same town. So you have to change the app store location to know what deals you get. When everything is what it says, runs smoothly, then it's a great way to save.",
      "It is a difficult app to use. It can't switch from in-store shopping without having to go through a couple of steps. it's hard to shop at home to make a list because my store doesn't allow pick up, so it shows the stuff is added to my list but all the totals are zero so I can't get a total. I go to check out it doesn't always load the coupons in the register when I put my phone number",
      "Fix your app! It's always messed up. Gives error message when scanning items -if u can even get that far and since update its a pain to get to my list - which I also had to erase and restart due to glitches. Always freezes up or after scanning a few things will no longer scan and just go back to main screen or will say everything is 0.00 til you close then reopen app then it works for about 2 minutes and starts messing up again.",
      "Sad to say, it's the only app for DG. The app shows wrong prices, not all items listed, either with price, or even a picture, or not even listed at all. The cart calculator is NOTHING but a hot mess for employees! This causes issues in stores. Coupons don't always work, or are not even available for use when they should be. The app needs to be updated with a major overhaul to make it actually work correctly. In short, this app is a joke to Dollar General.",
      "Good Idea, Failed Execution The ability to search for and add coupons and cash back to an app / program tied to your phone number is easy, convenient, and nowadays fairly standard. DG makes it easy to do that in their app. What it *cannot* do, apparently, is actually retrieve that information and honor the coupons and cash back at the store. The manager and I even went through every item that was supposed to be discounted, and she agreed that they were all legit. It just doesn't work."
