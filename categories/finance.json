      "At this point I can't get passed the screen that's green with a white $ in the middle. Can't click anything. All started after updating. They claim its my device which is a newer device and was just fine until yesterday. I try to access online, but I don't get anywhere. I call and they keep saying the same thing. Update I called to close account, and the gentleman I talked to said it wasn't my phone and sent it higher up. Update again they reached out and are working on it.",
      "Easy to use app to pay or request money and keep track of everything. Easily displays your accumulated balance, which can be easily transferred to your bank account. If there are no or insufficient funds, you simply withdraw them from your connected bank account. What I don't like is that I don't like to see other people's transactions between your connections, which means others can also see mine, so you need to be careful with your transaction descriptions or change your privacy settings",
      "I'm in the US yet this app continuously says \"cash not available in your region\" extremely inconvenient when it happens randomly without rhyme or reasoning. (Added later) I don't wanna go to support literally every time the app doesn't work right, just make an app that works 100% of the time. Venmo doesn't have this problem. Maybe yall could take some notes from them.",
      "Great services, not great customer service. Things I enjoy about the app are the automatic round-up savings, interest-earning savings account, overdraft protection, the \"Borrow\" feature, and ease of sending and receiving money. Unfortunately things I cannot recommend this app for, in particular, is paying for hotels that have security deposits (that are later supposed to come off, but take forever), and the customer service via Chat, which was frankly rude despite my attempts to be courteous.",
      "Best online money app I've ever used. Even though they take a dollar every time you put money on your card through a store or transfer it from your cash app to your bank it's a small price to pay for the very non-restrictive limitations otherwise in play. I absolutely adore the ability to lock and unlock the account at my own will. That is very \"clutch\" at repelling those extra or repeat charges for subscriptions you don't really want to be a part of but sometimes forget to cancel."

      "I have used PayPal for and it has been great. But, since I've used the pay in 4 option. I have been dealing with problems. Last night I tried to use the pay in 4 option for a payment, and was granted but my phone cut out of service. I went back today to do it and was denied. When I looked in my connected account, the deposit amount was taken from yesterday and the DENIED attempts today. I have tried calling and texting to fix this because I have pending transactions and can't go on.",
      "I understand the need for security, but the system is way too over the top. Sometimes if you just barely miss something it takes you 20 minutes to get past. Secondly, the website said it couldn't understand my request, so it's not smart enough to connect to google pay. Third, I can't add any of my cards. It keeps saying that that I have insufficient funds(Even though it said I didn't have to pay for anything) or that I need to add a different card, even though my card was VISA.",
      "They suck now. Their security methods are exhausting with all those little pictures to prove you're human. I've been told that they steal your information from your phone when they make you do those puzzles. Also, they changed the app so now I can't find my PayPal Credit balance in the app. I have to go online. And just because my balance went up to $90, it resulted in a 39 point drop on my credit score.",
      "if you actually need the money someone's sending you, you're better off using almost any other platform. PayPal will decide arbitrarily to send payments as an \"e-check\" which just means it's going to take a week to be put into your account for no reason. plus they're constantly trying to get you to sign up for credit cards and such and will bug you multiple times per transaction to do so. thinking about getting cashapp to avoid the wait times and constant popup bombardment",
      "What happened? it was good in the past. Most of the auto fill fields don't work. The lag from my click to display keeps me doubting if it registered me clicking on something. Less than 10% of the home screen is relevant to me. Changing addresses and card information is more difficult than it needs to be. I just use this for casual payments and it's a process anytime I use PayPal, I almost gave up on a $30 purchase today just because of all the friction, it took me almost 5 minutes to pay!"

      "super easy to use, withdrawal money, and send money. not to mention the spot me which is fee free you're just asked to tip to help others as well. I've had for almost 6 years and haven't had a problem. easy to dispute any charges and can control everything by app. would highly recommend to anyone. credit builder built my credit 100 points within 6 months.",
      "Qs far as Checking and savings accounts go, I've had a few issues but uexpected after banking 3+ years. But about a year ago I switched jobs and my new direct deposit started going here. Then all of a sudden my Credit Builder Card gets denied they closed my Credit Builder accout for no payment!! I forgot to add my direct deposit to take a portion of $ out which was shown as nonpayment! It's a Damn prepaid credit card, how can you not make a payment on a prepaid card. There NO payments to miss!!",
      "I love Tha different accounts, checking, credit builder and savings. easy to instantly transfer money between them, as much as you want and often as you want for free. nothing builds credit faster. also free boosts, go negative without penalty, you can earn money when your friends n family join with a direct deposit. I'll never use a bank again!!!",
      "They make it easy to move money between accounts and pay others across multiple platforms. If needed they offer free overdraft protection that comes in handy if money is tight. The credit builder card is fantastic to help build or repair your credit rating. They also have great rewards for referrals. I would recommend Chime to anyone.",
      "I've have physical bank buildings in my area to choose from. However, NONE of them were as friendly and helpful as Chime. The option to turn off all transactions is WONDERFUL. I admit when I first started my Chime account, I was skeptical. Due to the fact theres no physical building (in driving distance) if I did have a problem. On the few occasions, I needed to talk to someone a Chime representative was there. Gotta say thank you, Chime, for always having my back. Plus, my credit is going up!"

      "I was somewhat tricked into opening a Venmo credit account. All I wanted to do was pay a friend for a meal. I opened the app and was prompted to enter my address and income. Yes, I probably should have stopped and asked \"why\" but I was tired and thought they just wanted updated information. Turns out I opened a credit account. Support is all offshore and nearly useless. I was able the close the account but minor damage was done to my credit history because of this.",
      "Works fine, but SUPER annoying that I can't change top friends. My top friends are all people that I've venmoed once or twice almost 4 years ago, meanwhile I have to search manually for the friends I pay twice a week every single time. Why can't I edit my top friends? Or at the very least, why doesn't it automatically update to include people that I've paid in the last month 😭 super annoying, it's making me consider using a different app",
      "Payments have been fine, but I've never been able to pay anyone with my venmo balance or do an automatic transfer. I can only do a bank transfer or pay from my bank. I sent in documents for identity verification specifically for these reasons, but it's been at least half a year or more since I sent them in and nothing. Supposed to be 2-3 days for a response....yeah, okay. I've sent in several submissions to customer service asking about it and no response whatsoever. Customer service is a joke.",
      "For sending money to friends, great app. But lots of problems all the time with using the debit card attached to my account as well as funding the account. Sometimes it just won't work, no matter what. And customer service isn't open a lot of the time. When they are they make it hard as hell to reach a live person, then when you finally can all they say is sorry, they can't tell me why it's not working at this time and try again later. No solutions. So other than sending money it sucks.",
      "Venmo apparently is owned or a part of PayPal. However, it does not function anywhere near as well as PayPal. With PayPal, it's easy to get a hold of support in the event you have a problem via chat. You can't do that with venmo, you have to call them and navigate their phone assistant and hopefully if you hit the right number you will get a hold of a human. I hate venmo."

This is how money moves®.\n\nUsing just your recipient’s email address or U.S. mobile number, you can settle up simply and safely with almost anyone you know and trust. Even better, Zelle does not charge any fees to use the service. (Mobile carrier or bank fees may apply).\n\nGET STARTED:\n1.\tDownload the Zelle app.\n2.\tEnroll using a Visa® or Mastercard® debit card linked to a U.S. checking account; or \n3.\tEnroll your U.S. checking account by using your online banking username and password, if your bank supports this feature*.\n4.\tChoose a person to pay, or request money from, by entering their U.S. mobile number or email address.\n5.\tConfirm the amount and hit send. If they’re already enrolled with Zelle, they’ll typically get the money in minutes.

      "This App is completely unusable. Once you get to the create password section, it won't allow me to type in a password. My keyboard completely disappears and it looks like it's glitching out. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it multiple times, annnnd restarted my phone. Still won't work. I tried doing the \"copy and paste trick\" that I read on another review but no luck. I'm beyond frustrated!",
      "It's hit or miss with this app. I get error messages when trying to send people money, can't find them even though they're in my contacts, and they can't find me. I just had to send requests to friends for payments they were trying to send me.....we'll see if that works. Sometimes, the app works for me ,sometimes, it doesn't. Frustrating!",
      "I can anymore with zelle, why does it work only on and off. I love zelle, but if I don't use it on a regular basis, it doesn't function for whatever reason. I just checked to see if there was a new update that I needed, but no doesnt show one. It has me logged out, but I can click the sign in button. Everytine it seems like I will have to Uninstaller and re install, which makes you lose all previous zelle history and contacts. Zelle you need to get it together",
      "At first I experienced the password issue like everyone else. I solved that issue by typing my password and then copying to the clipboard. I then went back to the zelle app and would hold down on the word password. Slide your finger up just a little bit and the option to paste from clipboard stays available and you can enter your password, thus completing setup.",
      "Less than 1 star. The app won't scan my debit card. It moves the cursor to the beginning after typing first character in many of the fields. It won't keep the keyboard up while trying to enter a password and now is throwing errors when trying to log back in. How does anyone trust this app? Complete garbage!!!"

      "This app has lots of bugs. I was almost finished and tried to file multi states and it populated earned interest into the wrong state and you can't edit it. Lots of \"oops, can't find...\" when you click for more info. So I requested a call back. It took only a few minutes to get a call. But the support person couldn't help and he just ghosted me. I kept asking \"are you there?\" No answer. I've used turbo tax for over 10 years but now I won't use them again.",
      "Originally chose the package that was reduced to free. Then it forced me to upgrade to the expensive package because of some stupid credit that I dont think I even had. Ended up costing way more than I could afford for nothing. It's become hard to navigate when I need to add something; but when I finally found it I wasn't allowed to add or edit anything!!! The way they charge $$$ for nonsense makes it feel more like a scam than help. GO TO A LOCAL PERSON THAT DOES TAXES IT WILL BE CHEAPER!",
      "I apologize, I'm just frustrated. I don't want to influence anyone either way, I was speaking for my experience only and I have used and will continue to use TurboTax I just don't care for the app. I despise this app. I have to go through the whole verification process every time I try to open the app and have to change password each time. I even uninstalled and tried again with same results. This is so stupid...🤯",
      "It was dumb to think an app could do this complex job. I paid and had my files rejected 3 times through TurboTax. I got the exact same forms, paid someone else to file them for me and they went through immediately. Now TurboTax doesn't want to give me a refund for an unused service. Their customer service people are so bad, the hate for their job oozes through the call. I had to let the person know other non customer service jobs exist. Just an awful experience. Unprofessional, and fraudulent.",
      "Was forced to upgrade from free in order to claim a tax \"credit\". The \"upgrade\" costs $39... But that only covers federal... You have to upgrade your state taxes, too, even though it's a federal credit and doesn't effect state taxes. On top of that, they charge a $4 fee anytime you use a credit card, so now I'm down about $90... And the tax \"credit\" that I received for this ridiculous upsell? Exactly $0.... Intuit gets worse every year. I will never recommend any of their software."

      "Slow. For an App that is sponsored on the big stage of UFC, I expected a way more fluid user experience. The UI is confusing and average at best. Some crypto needs you to buy in specific increments and the app doesn't automatically do that for you, you have to manually adjust. Unacceptable in my opinion. I expected more from this app. In app customer service was responsive so that's good. Deposits worked well. Selling is a little easier than buying. 3/5 ⭐.",
      "Overall misleading marketing practices. I mostly have been trying to use the visa card, but it hardly works anywhere, and there's all these claims about getting cash back but it's at very specific locations and not entire chains. Any money on the card is basically locked up with no way to withdraw it. The quests are expensive. Overall not a beginner friendly app and misleading in many ways. There are much better options available",
      "Log in experience is just downright horrible! What kind of developers decided to let a ads popup cover the bottom half of the number options for entering PIN? I had to verify via email, verify via SMS, then the app asked for PIN which I wasn't able to provide because the popup covered the numbers I needed to enter, and then it locked me out because I failed to log in 3 times! Unbelievable!",
      "High spread, I truly hate the delay in the total asset amount. I do not know why my \"option\" trades decrease in value by a crazy amount while the price is way over my prediction and increasing. I think this app has a lot of potential, but it definitely needs work still. Would like to see better charts as well it's currently very limited. I'll give it 3 stars for now. Hopefully, changes are made.",
      "Prices don't sync right among other problems. But it has the most crypto though. If issues would be fixed then I'd rate 5 stars.\"Update\"still same problems but worse I've lost $5k+ because of these issues I bought a coin at .011 it went up to .0139+ and It sold for almost the same price I bought it at. made $20 when I should have made $500. currently it's not worth buying/selling a coin unless it 2x's or more because you won't get anything out of it. Tried talking support, no help won't respond."

      "I used to use Google Pay all the time and now with the new setup, it to difficult to turn off the NFC. Once you turn it on from the Wallet you have to go like 3 steps deep into the settings menu to turn it off. Gone are the days that you can easily turn it on and off from the pull down menu at the top of in the app. Until this is changed I will go back to using credit cards physically.",
      "It's terrible compared to Google Pay. Doesn't allow for locking the app (apart from the device screen lock). Send/request options gone, as well as tracking. This seems to be a complete jump backward. I'll be uninstalling and continuing to use Google Pay until it goes away in June. If Google Wallet hasn't improved by then, it'll probably be time to switch to Samsung Pay.",
      "Used it to pay for a $35 tank of gas and it showed a transaction amount of over $170. Had to pull up my card details to make sure it didn't over charge. (It didn't). This glitch combined with the lack of security settings (a review and confirmation screen, option to re-enter pin or fingerprint to confirm) these are basic security settings. Google, once a giant has fallen so far.",
      "Still can't add custom Loyalty cards easily in the GOOGLE WALLET app. The workflow is to \"take a picture\" and use the image to create the custom Loyalty card. Can't comment on the pay portion. I haven't used it in years. It never \"just worked\" so I gave up and use the card. At one point, the payment wouldn't work with the Android setting \"Require device unlock for NFC\". No idea if that ever got fixed. Probably not.",
      "Google Wallet is great when it works. But, several times, for no apparent reason, it has stopped working. I use it for my public transit card and have been left numerous times with no way to pay with plenty of money on the card. It is very frustrating and embarrassing. Today, I checked every setting and checked for updates. Everything is set correctly, but Wallet still won't work."

      "It used to work fine. I check my transactions, schedule payments, and book travel all the time. Recently the app became inoperable, stuck at the logo, a circle just spins and spins, and will not go to the logon page (i'm using fingerprint login, if that matters) I've reinstalled, and tried everything, it still is unusable. Others reported the same problem. Please fix the damn app. I'm seriously thinking of closing the credit card account. It's just too inconvenient to log on from browser.",
      "Loved the app when I first got it, I usually check it like every day. But lately every time I open it it just stays on the very first opening page for 5, 10 minutes, and never loads. Every. Single. Time. I've tried restarting it. Restarting my phone, switching between wifi and data. Nothing works it just stays on that screen the whole time.",
      "The app was perfectly fine up until this most recent update. Now you can't even use the app, it doesn't even go past the loading screen. It just spins and spins and spins. Ive restarted my phone, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, and still nothing. Expect us to pay our card bills on time but can't even get the app to load anymore. Thanks for breaking and ruining the app!",
      "You changed it. I don't like change. Edit: It's been awhile, I've added 2 more cards, and have gotten used to the app, therefore have increased my rating by 2 stars. nothing I would change. out of all my credit card/ banking apps,this Capital One is 100% the best. So easy to use and absolutely love the home page upon opening I can see my cards and balances very clearly! Good job, Capital One!",
      "I have always found this app really useful but since the last update I can barely open it. I live in a place with slower internet and it could be that the be version is so data heavy I can't use it here, but it is just stuck on the opening page with the logo or just the circle and never opens. But it always worked perfectly before. It seems like other people are also having this issue in the land of good internet. Hoping it can be fixed soon!!"

    "comments": [
      "I've used this app since 2017. I love the free app. the ability to check your scores and little words of encouragement that pop up when you make progress, and emails you get to improve, or look for a new card. I have had several loans thru this app giving recommendations and really love it! I wasn't a fan of the karma drive at first, but it did give me a great score on insurance! I received their Instant Karma feature when it first came out, which was awesome, but it's no longer available.",
      "Similar to others, too many ads. it's clear that the driving purpose of this app is to get you to buy other products. I can easily find information about my credit score and get a loan, but finding information about my budget is gone. The convenience from mint that made it so helpful in budgeting, such as categories, setting goals, etc, are gone. Too bad because I used it for years. Deleting the app and my account and moving on.",
      "One massive ad masquerading as an app. Mint had it's fair share of ads as well, but at least it was useful. Now, I no longer have my home screen widget that I had before, credit cards aren't linking correctly, I can't hide transactions and sub accounts from my net worth calculations, and I get way more spam then I did before. Way to screw up everything you touch, Intuit. All good in search of the all mighty dollar, I guess.",
      "I was forced to switch to this from mint. I can't find where I can view my individual transactions (don't think it exists) and it's more ads than information. I get needing some ads to keep the app free to me, but I feel like I'm giving away personal information for companies to better target me and to get hardly anything in return. The one positive I can see is that I now see two credit scores instead of one. Not that helpful. Very disappointed.",
      "I used to love this app, but it changed way too much. I don't know the score system they used to use because they no longer advertise it, so I assume they changed over to FICO scoring, which takes longer to update. I also noticed that their name changed to Intuit Credit Karma. It's too bad they ruined the app. Love this app! It lets me keep track of my credit score, and It gives me approval odds on credit cards and personal loans recommendations."

      "The new redesign is ok. It takes a few too many taps to get from the front page to being able to view debit/savings and actually do the things the app was built to do. I hate it when big UI updates are rolled out unexpectedly and it's especially jarring when it's something as personal and vital as banking. It makes me fear that policy changes will also be made very suddenly.",
      "Wasn't going to review but the app has become terrible. Stays stuck on loading upon opening the app. I've Uninstalled and reinstalled a couple of times but doesn't fix. All of this started since the latest update. Nothing more disappointing than not being able to check your checking and savings. Not to mention being scammed recently and the dispute being closed within a day after an unauthorized withdrawal and obviously was not in my favor. No number to call, only a \"chat\". Going back to a bank.",
      "Dont be mislead, there is no 'instant transfer' option. Its 1 to 3 business days. Unless you want to withdraw cash but it seems more complicated than casting a spell in Wiccan. L Update: well, the transfers aren't instant, but overnight is pretty close enough. And it was my employer w the shady wording. The app works really well and gives you alot of saving options. User interface might have gotten worse since the last update, but thats pretty much every popular app these days. Would recommend!",
      "My hope is one day they get as good as simple was before they closed. I'm a legacy user so I have a better features than people who are brand new to the app which I appreciate being grandfathered in but I feel everyone should have access to the same features and perks I have. They're slowly bringing back certain features that they removed after the merger but it's getting back to where it was slowly. App can be glitchy at times. Like right now it's not letting me see any of my balance.",
      "Edit. I got a review statement in my email and all it does is send me here to the Google Play store. I love this app, better than Bluebird by American Express. This app has a lot of great features. Not all things are intuitive but I eventually find what I am looking for. Love the 3% in my savings pockets. I haven't yet had an issue. Highly recommend. I'm on an old Android A02s."

      "The app often says I used my phone while driving when my phone is in my purse on my passenger seat for the whole ride. I wish they would improve that or stop tracking phone use. I'm tired of seeing that I used my phone 6 times when I didn't even look at it, much less touch it. Very frustrated. I think I might have 5 stars if the app worked right.",
      "The Snapshot feature is a safety issue. It incentivizes breaking less, and now I second guess myself when I do require hard braking to avoid collisions. It also doesn't give you a chance to justify the false reports it gives, like it saying the driver used their phone if the passenger actually used their phone or if hard braking was used in the course of defensive driving to avoid a collision. It also doesn't let you go back very far in its history to change when you're a passenger.",
      "The App should not record any \"phone use\" while someone is parked and stationary! Where's the logic in that? What's the point then in pulling over and STOPPING to use the phone if you're STILL going to be penalized? Might as well just use your phone while you're driving then. Instead of being rewarded for good driving habits the App makes sure you're penalized. Worst. App. Ever.",
      "Constant battery drain. I have to force close it all the time, but then snapshot stops tracking. For example today, the dumb app ran for 9 hours straight and used 13% total battery. I drove for 30 minutes in total today. Such a joke. EDIT: still an issue. Sitting completely idle on the phone without any driving can use up to 8% in a day.",
      "They cant/won't help you on the phone or in chat. If they can help, it's going to cost you. I even tried to stop automatic payments for one month, and they were going to charge me like 40 bucks total, and they said it may or may not stop my automatic payments anyways....if you are new to progressive, go with another company. This is my 3rd poor experience with them, 3 strikes."

Typical bank. Credit journey could be more informative; my number regularly fluctuates by 20-30 points but the explanations are always the same, but having the info on hand is good. Offers are ok. Haven't used the travel/points redemption area of the app yet.",

I then have to re-log in and try again and again and again. Absolutely HATE this app. Needs a LOT of work. Can't wait to pay this card off so I can cancel it and never have to deal with this garbage app again .",
      "I do love the apps features, but it runs terribly slow and constantly crashes or freezes my phone during the login process. my phone can handle all the games I install, even really resource heavy ones so I am not sure why it's struggling to load so much but it's been this way the whole time I've had it, it's been years. I still love the features and how easy it makes things when it works but it's always a gamble if I'll even be able to log in without my phone freezing.",
      "Want random, normal purchases to be flagged as fraudulent?? Download the Chase App! Hoping to miss out on hard-to-get releases because of dogshit fraud detection?? Chase Bank will mess that up for you too! Just check Google and you'll see that this has been an ongoing problem for Chase customers for 5+ years. Seems no one at Chase is smart enough to fix it! The best solution is closing your accounts - which I highly recommend.",
      "Seriously regretting getting chase for the rewards points. The booking site is completely archaic. Very difficult to look through hotels, and absolutely no options to put in how much you would like to spend either above your points or if you would like to view hotels only with in your point range. The map refreshes anytime you move it so that you lose track of what it was you were looking at. And it list hotels aren't even available. Over all super frustrating."

      "For an app that wants to help you save money, it can do that for a VERY expensive price. I signed up through a referral link from a creator to get a week free trial, and after the week is up I got charged the annual price of the \"monthly subscription\" that you chose to pay. Good thing I lowered it from $10 a month default to $4 because I would've been out $120 immediately which not everyone can afford. Would not recommend this app until they charge you monthly like expected. I feel lied to.",
      "Does not let me cancel some subscriptions I'd like to cancel. The option just simply isn't there. Apparently I'm paying for Netflix twice somehow and it's listed as A2A, but when I click the 3 dots on it, there is no option to cancel the subscription. And the chat for customer service is a joke. Can't actually chat for help. You can only select from a list of options.",
      "Good money management and budgeting app. Love being able to see all my balances in one place and track recurring bills, however, could be better with biller connections for real due dates and amounts instead of projections based on past transactions, like Mint and Prism used to have. I think that Intuit is a big enough company to make this happen if a smaller app like prism could do it. Rocket has better monetization than mint or prism did and that feature would make me want to pay for premium.",
      "As a retiree, I found Rocket Money helpful and it provides much understanding of my financial status. Everything I need to monitor is at my finger tips. I am kept informed of all activities prior to the transaction occurring. Easy transition between transactions and net worth. I find it easy to use and educational. I love it! ❤️👍",
      "It is super easy to use and I started saving money right from the start. I was able to open up a savings account and have what I save transfer in there . I used to just look at my statement online, never really questioning everything. Rocket money has me looking at my account and my transactions without all the stress and confusion. Knowing my money better helps me to save my money better. I really do love it!"

      "The BoA app is really user friendly. There's a few things that are a little hard to find but after some searching, you can find your way. That's layout discrepancies, not functional. I find it helpful and easy to deposit checks too. And, if there's funny activity, it's laid out well to get you on track and secure. Security is not an issue as you are alerted if they find anything suspicious starting. Really is a friendly and useful app.",
      "Taking it down a star or two as the app seems to digress with each update. Notable degradations include worse check-deposit imaging/reliability and deteriorated navigation/site architecture making it more difficult to find and execute tasks like Start ATM withdrawal. It has been a great app up until recently. No real technical issues or crashes.",
      "Normally I would rate this one of five. But today I find that on my tablet and my phone, both android, I have wasted time to find out that I can't just easily look at the check images anymore. They are supposedly now in my gallery, and I checked my Google photos, but they're not there. Tried to edit the description of one check. It would not save. Strange note about a missing token for that transaction. Why did you change something that was working just fine before?",
      "Used to be better. I only had to select a single option to pay off a credit card in the statements page from my checking account. They now make you jump through an ever more increasing number of hoops to do it. You now have to go to Pay & Transfer > Pay Bills > Add Payee > Add a Company, and then put in the credit account number and full amount to pay (you'll have to remember from memory or else it erases). This can eventually lead to some people being late in their credit card payments.",
      "The \"Mark As Paid“ button on Bill Pay doesn't work well. It's too close to the \"Pay\" button so unless you have a stylus, which I don't it it keeps wanting to default to Pay button and going that route. I have a very hard getting it to mark as paid. Existing problem for years. This section needs to be reworked. Hoping the dev team sees this!"

      "If I could rate 10 stars I would. I can't say enough good things about Cash App! I use it for all my banking needs. I get paid 3 days early, I save money with roundups, my ATM fees are reimbursed and now I have $50 free overdraft protection! Love this app more than PayPal or Venmo. So easy to send and receive $. No waiting for verification or anything. And almost everyone is on cash app. Super easy to look people up whether or not they are on your contact list",
      "To view your card info you have to open up chrome and go to autofill. If you want to adjust payment settings you need to go the Google app instead. But if you want to tap-to-pay you use google wallet, but if you want to view your transactions you have to use this pointless app. Google took the concept of uncomplicated, convenient, and all in one place, and said \"let's do the polar opposite!\" Half of google searches are just people troubleshooting stupid issues that Google itself created",
      "I've been using it for a while. Really convenient not needing to dig for my wallet everytime. My only wish is that there was some way to get digital receipts when you pay, and they appear in the wallet/pay app. Pretty sure the checkout retail needs to update in order to achieve this, but you'd think saving paper receipts would be good motivation. Still... It's a great app.",
      "Overall, this is a really good app. Especially since the last update that requires users to unlock to use Google Pay. I wish they made access to the wallet a little easier. Currently, pay and insights are on a menu at the bottom but to access wallet you have to go to the menu at the top right, then open wallet. Wallet really needs to be at the bottom where Pay and Insights are located.",
      "Definitely a nice feature if you forget your wallet,purse,debit card,etc., and absolutely have to have gas or something important! Only thing I really wish you could add as a feature would be that it would show you the balance/amount able to spend on each of the attached card accounts. Just a thought, idk if that's something you could even implement into the app, but I'm sure I'm not the only person who would benefit from a feature like that."

      "EDIT : I was able to cash out and it processed pretty fast. I was surprised. I'm $4 away from the cash out minimum, and my check list keeps glitching. I past the requirement on one game, but it didn't check it off. And I downloaded a new game and passed the requirement and haven't gotten it. Plus there is no way to let the app know when you have a problem with an offer. UPDATE I am at the cash out point, but it want me to do a facial recognition and it wont accept it or somthing.",
      "The variety of available games is better than most other play to earn services. I haven't hit the minimum payout yet, which I believe is a little high (the reason for 4 stars instead of 5), but I have heard of others cashing out. You just have to make sure you read the instructions for each game, some have different requirements. For some you have to finish all the goals, others you don't. Some have different limits on how long you have to finish quests. Overall I'm happy with it.",
      "Played the Monopoly all the way, it stopped tracking it partway through, tried to cash out, won't cash out, tried township, began tracking it but then stopped. The whole thing is a waste of time and a scam. They just want information, your information, so they can sell it. You get no compensation for anything. And all the games want you to do is purchase, purchase, purchase. If you're evaluating things you shouldn't need to purchase. I give it a zero if that was an option",
      "I do love the concept of this app, is better (so far) than any of the other earth money apps I've tried. The goals for each game are realistic, and achievable. I would like checking my progress on the games to simpler, however. Other than that I'd recommend it to friend and family. I would've given four our five stars, but haven't completed all of my goals yet\\cashed out yet. But that's because I've only been using the app for a few weeks now.",
      "I didn't play because after install and email sign up, it's pretty clear that games within app require tracking install...not worth any pay out for me personally . Also if forgetting to click \"agree to terms\" the prompt text refers to the terms & conditions as \"hint\". I'll update this review if I begin to receive spam email. Many of these types of apps just seem to be predator apps on folks needing groceries or rent funds."

      "so many hidden fees despite my account meets criteria. FED should close this pos bank down. I'm closing my account after wasting years with this pos bank. It is really hard to find your credit card history transaction and such. I hate this app and bank. So many clicks to see all your \"deposits\" in an account. Need to move the \"filter\" option to each account tab once selected for easy access. Unable to log one the first time, always take 2-3 times to log on.",
      "I like to pay down my CC statement balance a couple chunks at a time, to keep my balance low and not impact my credit score. I really don't like how this app doesn't show the remaining statement balance, they just show the last statement balance. Makes it more complicated to figure out what the remaining statement balance is. The Amex app makes this super easy. It's a simple formula, please just add it to the app as a visual aid and a selectable payment option.",
      "Horrible. Used to work fine for years yet lately for months now, wow, took many attempts to finally got in, always showed all kind of error message, recently said something like lets verify you in different way, really bad. I try to avoid using the app but I have to when depositing checks and it is sp frustrated. It is a big bank so we would expect good technologies but not so much at all.",
      "For the last five or six months this app has become extremely difficult with the login process. EVERYTIME I log on it does the same thing. I go through the ENTIRE logon process only for it to make me start all over once I reach the six digit code that is texts my phone. Today it took me six tries before I could get to the home menu. Extremely frustrating to have to go through this EACH damn time. Fix it!",
      "Now, it's October and the latest \"features\" introduced include not being able to transfer funds between accounts, view notifications, or pay bills. Last month, the new feature was an inability to take a photo of a check when using the online deposit feature. Wow! Reverse improvements. Here's an idea: howabout working harder on functionality. Maybe?"

      "Wish I could give this app a 4.5 rating, it's nearly perfect. Any issues that come up are resolved very quickly by their staff. Sending money is very reliable as long as the receiving party doesn't have any issues on their end My only complaint with the app, is it no longer shows how much money I can send before running into the limits. Before it would show daily, monthly and 180 days in the profile section, but now that feature is completely missing. Please bring it back, very useful.",
      "I am a long time user of Remitly. I am very happy with this service, but the newest version of the App is annoying. When you are done using the App, you can't shut it off easily. I swipe up, which brings up options on every other App on my phone, except Remitly. I have to swipe down, and bring up my phone's settings options, then go to my home screen from there. This needs to be corrected, like yesterday. Hijacking People's web browser is not a path to satisfied users.",
      "I use Remitly often, and I appreciate the quick manner in which they send the money. I also like that their quotes to transfer are much larger than other apps. Recently, they have also added pix which allows me to send money faster to other people I couldn't reach before. I had an issue and was able to solve the problem with 1 phone call. Highly recommend this app.",
      "Remitly was my to go app to send money, but lately, I am unhappy with the latest update. Although they changed the sending free from $3.99 to $1.99, the exchange rate is now very low compared to other apps/ places. I am honestly looking for another app to use instead of Remitly. Also, this app used to have the option to send money instantly, but now that option is no longer available.",
      "I really liked remitly at first. It was easy to use and reasonable sending fee. The recipient received transfers within minutes in their bank account, but recently there has been problems and I'm needing to contact customer service. I paid the fee, but the transfer doesn't go through right away and the status is \"In Progress\". So what is the point of paying $3.99 for express when it's not express?! It's very inconvenient. I need to look for a new app to send money."

      "Not worth having anymore. Was really great to have when u first downloaded it a few years ago. Now it takes forever to load and has locked me out. When you call to reset your account, you get the run around. 03/01/2024 update: The gas since improved drastically. The presentation is simple but functional. An the added features expand how the app can be used. Less glitches",
      "This app is so much more than just an EBT card balance. It has so much more, and it's so easy to use. I'm so glad I downloaded it!! Edit 3-8-2024 I got a new EBT card due to unseen issues and I can't load it in the app. And absolutely no one will help me fix the issue!!! I have written to absolutely everyone who could possibly help me with fixing this issue and no body has or will. New rating is **",
      "Great app with getting information for resources. Sometimes, the app won't connect, but it rarely happens. I had to get a replacement card, and it was easy to remove the old and add the new. However, I did like the old version more because it showed me when my deposit came in and how much.",
      "This app was a wonderful utility at first. But lately, it has been extremely slow to load. And once you do get it to load, it more often than not says that it is unable to connect to your record. BUT NOW, when it loads it says, \"APP COULDN'T LOAD\" and some extremely amateurish link displaying SEND INFO. You guys are making me afraid to use your app with all the hacking going on. PLEASE FIX THIS AND RESTORE OUR CONFIDENCE IN USING THIS APP!!",
      "Have loved using this app. Super convenient to find out updates and new things going on. This month however i haven't been able to open it successfully, keeps repeating that its unable to load at this time. I uninstalled today and reloading. Was able to open but it is still running very slow."
