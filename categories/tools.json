      "For me, this app has been a great help! Whether scanning QR codes or UPC barcodes, I've had no issues with reading them, or reading them accurately would be a better way of describing the experience that I've had with the app. It really speeds the process of item listing in online auction sites as well.......",
      "Works great. Just as long as you know the difference between the link and the advertisements. It is a bit deceptive. The app has a large green open button, clicking on that open button takes you to the add. The actual link that has been scanned is at the top of the screen. It is deceptive in that manner. If you are aware of it, you won't have any trouble with it. For a free QR and Barcode scanner it preforms exactly as it should. I can deal with add's for a quality app. Good job",
      "Works great. I haven't tried every code scanner. But I tried a lot that were nothing but problems. This one does as discribed. Ads are on the bottom of the screen and don't adversely affect your ability to scan barcodes, and look at information on the internet about the item scanned. It works, as discribed. The app developer should get props for a integrity and not wasting my time. I found no \" new problems, or strange phone behavior\" no abuse of my data. I am definitely going for the upgrade.",
      "Works as expected, though ads are not vetted for deceptive practice. Most ads have a big call-to-action button beneath them, either \"Open\" or \"Install\". This button is not an obvious part of the ad and schemed to look like a functional part of the app. When showing the \"Open\" button, it is entirely too easy to confuse with a button that would open the link decoded from the barcode. Although the ad is labeled as such, it needs to be visually framed. Until that happens, this app is deceptive.",
      "Similar complaint as other users have said. When I scanned a QR, it brought up two links. One link with a big blue button that was actually an ad. The other link which was the one I wanted, was much more inconspicuous. I was in a rush trying to pay for parking. I accidentally opened the ad link thinking it was to pay for parking. I foolishly filled out the form and entered my credit card info. Now, my bank account has been hacked because the link is a scam site. 1 star for hosting a scam."

      "Liking the new app. It's working great on my Pixel 7 Pro. The app runs faster, is less glitchy and doesn't time out. I like how the new split screen lets you sit across from each other and read the text. I use this to translate Thai, which is a notoriously difficult language. The app isn't perfect but does much better giving an accurate translation. It would be nice to be able to save larger transcripts than currently able to now.",
      "I am extremely disappointed in this app. It has been working fine for years.... and now all of a sudden it says there's no connection and it will not work. I have tried all the troubleshooting things available out there including the links noted below but the problem persists. Clearly there is an issue with the app and needs to be updated given all the negative reviews recently I hope you guys can fix this quickly because I rely on this app daily. PLEASE READ MY FULL REVIEW! ALREADY DID ALL THAT",
      "Great app. It is fairly accurate for the most part. Occasionally, I do verify the translation through another source. The live camera portion still needs some work to be useful. My favorite feature is having the translate icon show up when I copy a word. This makes translations even faster. I did not give it more stars because there is still room for improvement.",
      "See, I use this to translate for elderly people that can't see, and I wanted the ability to flip my phone sideways to show them the translated word and it would show the translation at a full screen. They can't see 20 point font, the word has to literally be 72 point font! So bring back the full screen experience! NOW!",
      "Was five stars, now zero. I work at a hotel with many Latino employees and this had been the best translator app out there. Then one day I open it up and it won't function at all. I uninstalled and reinstalled it, restarted my phone, nada. I have a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, and I hope they fix it because it was easily the best one with the best features, because I've tried them all. It's your update, Google, not our phones, not how we're using it. Totally nonfunctional. Fix it!"

      "I purchased a new Samsung device for the holidays. My previous tablet had zero problems transferring my data. Unfortunately, that is NOT the case this time. I follow all the prompts, but for some reason, the wireless transfer gets to 5.4% before saying the connection is lost. I have tried numerous times with no success. HOW does the connection keep getting dropped when the devices are literally right next to each other?! Samsung has been losing cool points lately!",
      "Seems to copy almost all apps and data. CAUTION- Turn WiFi to DHCP on the old phone because it over-writes your WiFi settings on the new phone then disconnects for IP conflict if it's set to static IP. When using a USB-C data cable with a lot of data be sure to have a wireless charger set up! When transferring files is interrupted it doesn't pick up where it was interrupted so you could end up with a lot of duplicate or triplicate files. Sure beats doing it all manually though!!",
      "I don't get all the negative reviews. I used it to transfer data from my old Galaxy phone to the new one and It worked like a charm for me. It did take some time to transfer data but it wasn't more than an hour. I was also transfer pretty heavy size of data. All of my files, device settings and even the app data was transferred without much hassle. Totally loved it!",
      "The App, is as useless, as a Comb is to a Baldmans Head. It only works if you have a higher Android Phone UI, depending on your Model Type; otherwise, it won't work with a much older Cell Phone, with a less UI, let alone, if you don't have wireless, because it does NOT transfer data. Better, to Screenshot or USB, from another source all of your important Passwords, from your Apps, Contacts, etc., to your Phone manually; itwould probably less risk of bringing unnecessary junk to your new Phone.",
      "It does help, but the ads are annoying AND misleading. Some look like part of the app, and someone lacking my keen technical acuity ;) could get confused and screw things up. Ads make it quite cumbersome. Cabled transfer did not work at all. The app is essential, and does work well, but it doesn't have to be this difficult."

      "Only wanted to use this to transfer text messages and it didn't work fully. A lot came over, but a lot didn't. Messages from my wife stopped at August 2023, today is January 30th, 2024. No media included in messages came over. Other friends texts stopped at October, November last year. Can't trust what came over and what didn't. Tried updating both phones and resetting iPhone several times, but got the exact same result everytime. If I can't trust it for messages, I won't trust it at all.",
      "DO NOT USE THIS APP!!! After a two hour file transfer, the majority of my messages and apps were gone, contacts merged into groups, thousands of photos are a jumbled mess. It even erased my bookmarks and cleared my favourites on tik tok. Once the “transfer was complete” my Samsung will not turn on or even charge. It’s killed my android phone so I can not recover everything that was lost. DO NOT USE THIS APP.",
      "This app did a decent job transferring data, but it is far from perfect. Group text messages don't really transfer seamlessly. On my new iPhone, my phone number is included in each group as an unknown contact. Google accounts don't actually get transferred, even though \"Google accounts\" is listed as an option to transfer. App data doesn't get transferred at all, which kind of makes sense. Be prepared to setup every individual app after the transfer is complete.",
      "This app is honstly a good way to transfer your android data to your Iphone. Most of what I had on my android moved over without being corrupted. This includes all my messages, phone numbers, apps, and photos. The only bad thing about it is having to wait about 2 hours with your phone on through the whole process. My only other complaint is the duplication of my photos and videos in which I had to go back and manually delete duplicates. Otherwise it is a very useful app if you want to switch.",
      "I am dumbfounded by the negative reviews. I don't know what I would've done without this app as I use my phone for business as well as personal, and my text messages are essential to maintain. I was able to transfer all seamlessly including photos and data. It was completed in less than 15 minutes over Wi-Fi. I was afraid to go back to Apple for the reason of data transfer. This app made it a breeze and I recommend it to anyone making the change. (FYI, Pixel 7 Pro to iPhone 15 Pro Max)."

      "It used to be a useful app, back when it actually worked. However, that has since become a rare occurrence. On the rewards page, although the links work, the text is missing and everything else is so distorted that it is worthless. The same occurs on web pages and news articles. Uninstalling and reinstalling temporarily fixes the issues, but it isn't long before they return (or new ones arise).",
      "This new Verdi of Bing has really hit it out of the park. My new AI assistant Copilot is extremely intuitive, this is the next level of AI, it has been an extraordinary resource and the best that I've found. Trust me, I have experimented with lots of ai and I am constantly disappointed. Copilot is a real game changer and will have set the standard for years to come. And its free!",
      "Super flaky. Crashes constantly. Not only is this app backed by a second rate search engine, but they've shoved their artificial unintelligence agent into every screen at the expense of all other features. News feed is a spammy dumpster fire, and the rest of the app is just a hot mess. Bing, Microsoft News, Office, etc. All have been sacrificed at the alter of Copilot. If only it actually worked. Microsoft is obviously not in the business of writing consumer software anymore. Good luck Satya.",
      "Just using the Nearby feature in the apps section, I hope we get a stand-alone navigation app from Microsoft. Also, it doesn't support Passkey. Please add it. I don't get it, who uses this app when there is Microsoft Edge?? Microsoft makes configurations so often. Also, there is a Start app developed by Microsoft which looks and works exactly like this Bing app.",
      "Pretty flaky overall. Most features either don't work or only work sporadically. I absolutely hate that it creates a separate entry in recent apps for every single tab you open. Bing itself is an app and should only appear once in recent apps list. For some reason it randomly sometimes starts showing me news in the UK... Deals and rewards are all game-ified, but at least half the time you won't get any points for doing what it tells you to. Just don't bother... With the rewards, or the app."

      "Got really tired of things not working correctly. Cloud syncing refused to work. On the rare occasion it actually did sync it would add all the entries from the cloud as duplicate entries. Lacking in a lot of features and it's a pain trying to migrate to a different app. I switched to Aegis Authenticator and it was the best decision I ever made. Took a while to switch my accounts to Aegis thanks to Google not allowing you to export to other apps, but no regrets.",
      "Was fine for over a year then all of a sudden my codes won't work on any website I use it for. I tried syncing but it keeps telling me \"it appears to be synced already.\" I made sure it was updated. I transferred it from one email to another and I was able to log in to one account. Tried logging into the same account again and couldn't do it. Uninstalling and reinstalling fixed it for now but I'm not optimistic.",
      "I've used this app without issue for years. All of a sudden, all of my data was deleted along with all of my backups. I didn't update or reset anything. I tried logging into my Google account, and nothing was there. Now, I can't access a bunch of my accounts, both personal and for work. Also, I can't get ahold of anyone at Google to assist. Even the old backup codes didn't work. Use MS Authenticator instead.",
      "Would love to give this app 5 stars, as it’s a straightforward design that does one thing well.  Almost.  Since earlier this year, the app has not refreshed its list of authentication codes when the 60-second countdown timer rolls over.  Given that many sites don’t have a grace period for codes from the preview 1-2 minutes, this is a stupid UI misdesign or bug (I’m going with the latter).  The lack of a fix makes me wonder if Google hasn’t abandoned this product.",
      "intuitive, consistent, minimal 2FA app with one minor bug great app, allows you to sync to your google account for multi-device or transferring. single point of failure, minor security concerns, but very convenient, so it's worth it. bug: it crashes whenever i try to rearrange my accounts aside from that, no major complaints, very consistent and reliable 2FA app, intuitive, easy to sync/transfer, been using it for ~5 years, no complaints aside from one avoidable crash condition."

I let it go for a few weeks to see if it was other apps that caused this issue.... Nope. It was this app. Also the reason I got the app was bc it was advertised as a wall stud finder which is a lie.

      "Works perfectly. Works great for the network I've tested it on so far. It's typically fast but can be slow at times, but I really can't complain since it's free. Though sometimes (not often) can be buggy when you shut it off or can possibly randomly disconnect. When that happens all you have to do it turn disconnect, exit the app, turn off your wifi, turn it back on, and restart the process. Overall I would say it's definitely a great free VPN, even comparable to the paid for VPNs.",

IDK! anyways, Jan 12, 2024 they took the payment for 1 year and Jan. 13 I requested a refund through google play, but google play sent me an email that I need to contact the developer. I already sent an email to the developer and hopefully they give me my money back.",

      "Video ads are not supposed to be playing on a browser and when i click on the try it for free it says that my password is incorrect even when i type the correct password and why should we pay when it says that it is for free it has to be payment free and thats it and you need to remove ads from this app because i cant afford to buy ads free"

Best approach is to let the phone ring in all familiar possible locations.

I eventually found my phone, and when I opened Find My Device, it initially listed all the devices, but then wiped out the list and it is now blank as well.",
      "It was working fine all the time just until today this evening. All of a sudden, now my devices are no longer showing or listed. and it's telling me that there are \"No active devices\". Had to clear the storage on install and then reinstall it again just to see if my device's would to will appear on the app. Had to to also go extenxed links by restarting my phone just to find a resolution. Nothing! So if I lose my phone that I'm screwed. What is going on here?"

Problem is, the extra space you earn is temporary, not permanent. App is loaded down with so many pop ups, they interfere. Features are hit and miss. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. Premium is worth the price, if you want to pay. Upload speed is decent, but downloading a file you have uploaded previous is hit and miss.",
      "They will mislead you with thousands of ads and prompts to buy the premium options, even though you are already a premium user. They want you to think that you did not purchase the premium option for some reason, and they want you to buy their subscription repeatedly. When I contacted them about this, I discovered that I had multiple subscriptions for the same service within the same account. They confirmed the multiple subscriptions and declined my refund request. So they are 100% cheaters",

      "I've gotta rate this app 5 stars. I first installed it on my tablet and seen immediate improvement. Baseball is starting and I was streaming the game on my phone, and I use Verizon, Samsung. The best streaming there is. Never had issues in all the years I've streamed games all season, and all year round, until today. If Verizon samsung starts lagging, you know something is wrong. After having success with this app on my tablet I figured it was worth a shot. Immediate improvement once again.",
      "It's one of those apps that work. Kt doesn't interrupt you in the middle of your phone conversation or some show you may be watching. I like this app because it's simple and fast. It does what is created to do and nothing more or less. And you're phone has added security as well as more space for storage that you need and not the rubbish of duplicate files of junk. Thanks . Q",
      "The ads are worth the service. Cleaned my phone up in 20 min and can track the electric current through the battery monitor in real time. They could make it easier to cancel the ads when the time runs out though, kinda forces ya to see or accidentally click other stuff. So -1 for deceitful ads. Also like the anti virus page ironically having a trojan virus style ad in the result page. Saying Warning! Use it then uninstall",
      "At first I gave it a 5 star. You do have to watch a good amount of ad's. I take it back I've noticed the WiFi network scan and test parts have issues. There's days it has glitches and loads slow. It feels like it takes a while to get through all the parts. It's worth it to me if it works correctly. I really love that it's all in one though.",
      "Fast, reliable, a lot of options to be able to do to clean out your phone. Free. There is an option to buying better if you want to pay for it. I think it's free one works perfectly fine it's fast fast. I think it's a very good app and it should be used by people. I forgot to mention it is also antivirus cleaner too so it cleans your phone and checks for viruses Love it"

      "The app is basically a facelift for your router home page, but it's missing dozens of standard router homepage settings such as hiding your network. Their equipment doesn't let you access the router settings without using the app which means you have limited options if you want to configure your network. Bring your own network equipment if you want a normal router that has full features.",
      "I've complained about this nonsense before, but FIX IT! Ya'll have great tech, but you are SO slow fixing bugs and issues. I have to sign in FROM THE START periodically, even though I check the box TO STAY SIGNED IN! And ANY time I go back into the app I have to put my dumb fingerprint in, even though I was in the app 3 seconds ago! It's the greatest (not) when the sign in completely starts at the beginning! (Not.)",
      "The update has bugs. It's so irritating. Wouldn't even recognize my credentials. Using a browser I had no issues logging in so that narrowed it down to the app. Simple tasks take a long time, forget being able to contact support or doing anything else for that matter, it's not happening. You can pay your bill no problem, which I guess was the priority. Gotta get paid first. If I could rollback I'd do it in a heartbeat. This is how the cookie crumbles and I guess now we wait for the fix.",
      "I love Spectrum and their services. I had AT&T before this and my God was it awful! Spectrum has came out quickly to resolve the issue I had on 2 occasions. They swapped out equipment and ran new wiring to completely eradicate any issues immediately. Other than those 2 times, we have had zero issues. I have multiple services with them because it turns out to be cheaper to have more services.",
      "Updated no longer works. Deleted reinstalled does not work. Tried 3 other devices. Does not work. In all cases will not even open!..... Unavailable often after midnight when I need to use it. Please add Amazon, Hulu, Disney, Paramount Apps in the Appstore. It's very convenient having Netflix and YouTube in the menu. Would be great and actually makes me value my cable when searching on another app that does not have a cable available show!"

      "Down to one star. VPN usually works when it connects. However, the number of times network access slows or stops working for a few minutes is only increasing. Connecting is sometimes very slow, as well. And the ads they push through the notification bar to refer a friend can't be disabled in app. Support told me they would disable them on their end, but apparently they either didn't, or they have since re-enabled them. I'll be keeping an eye out for an alternative. Proton seems promising.",
      "Update: Do yourself a favor and try any other VPN. Very disappointed in Nords service and support. I'm not the only one; it's a very common issue. Constantly disconnects, and takes forever or times out, then won't re-connect. Very often times or when trying to connect to any server. Tried all of Nords suggestions to no avail. Often, when it does connect, throughput is slow, maybe 30% slower than without.",
      "VPN will not connect! Let me be more clear.. when I hit the quick connect button, the button does not respond. It does not do anything. Even if I try connecting directly to a particular city, I get the same reaction. It's the craziest thing I've ever seen. I have used NordVPN in the past and haven't had this issue. The only thing I've changed since then and now is I went from an Apple device to a Pixel. Other VPN's do not obfiscate ip on Google pixel when using Google to search.",
      "These guys provide one of the best vpn services out there. They also provide a secure place for passwords and a secure way to transfer small files between devices. the only significant problem I have is when running the vpn 247 all day all night it will either lose connection or disconnect. Which when it does it won't reconnect unless I restart the app pr my phone.",
      "Connection keeps dropping when phone goes to sleep. All settings are set to unrestricted data and battery. EDITED 2/17: Found app blocker in settings to be the culprit. Turn off all blocks. But the key is to restart the phone after making the changes. It won't take effect until a restart occurs. So far no drops in either battery saver or regular modes. Overnight the connection seems to stay as well."

      "Was pleasantly surprised at how many brands and models of TV this works with. I got an old TV secondhand and it didn't come with a remote, now I don't need to buy a replacement right away. Took just a minute to set up and works great. Only issue is that I wish it had more than the bare minimum buttons. (I was really hoping I could use this app to change the display picture size.)",
      "Remote works but ads are annoying. I understand that ads make it possible to get free apps; however, there are times when ads can make an app unusable. Using a remote requires frequent button pushing. It's annoying when a clickable ad pops up just as you are pressing a remote button, and you accidentally open the ad. Seems kinda sneaky in my opinion. I might just write my own app.",
      "Too many ads that bug up using the app. I can't stomach waiting for the app to connect. It did connect but didn't do more than messing with the volume. The ads are always fighting against your ability to learn the app because of the constant need of getting you to click an ad. I'm out!",
      "Connected to my television without any problems, but it could only control the volume. The ads were also very annoying. So I spent $24 to get rid of ads and unlock all the features. It said that it would let me use the touch screen and all of the other buttons. The ads stopped, but I can still only control the volume. I even restarted my phone. Feels like a scam. Update: Apparently it doesn't work with my Brand TV. It should say that somewhere. Still one star.",
      "This app actually works, it has ALL or MOST tv brands, even cable. I downloaded it and it's honestly better than most apps, it has ads every once in a while but there only picture ads, The app is good yes, but I gave it 4 stars because it is a bit slow during times. But other than that if you lost your remote I recommend. Have a great day or night! 💗🥰"

      "Protects my privacy while browsing, and now has an app privacy protection feature that stops apps from sharing my personal information. Well done! It's worked well for me for years. However, recently it's started taking longer to load pages and I'm at times getting messages that the browser can't open a webpage. It's not my wifi as Chrome does not have the same problems. Hopefully this will be fixed in an update soon.",
      "This is by far The Best Browser I have used on my Android device. I no longer get all of those irritating, unwanted ads that cover content and don't have a close button! I would like to be able to use voice searches on this browser that are not on my menu, like Google. I am researching how to resolve this not included feature. So, I must use the Google Voice Search that I Do Not like temporarily, unfortunately. Nonetheless, I highly recommend this browser. It gives me more freedom. No ad wars!",
      "😐 The DuckDuckGo app is: mostly improved lately. [My Favorites bookmarks suddenly disappeared. Multiple detailed reports submitted and AFTER MONTHS, no response. Many web pages just won't work; FEEDBACK REPORTS IGNORED (The app crashes multiple times per day; Audio streams repeatedly stop only seconds after initiating the play/'playback'; It's useless for things such as audio, and others; I've had to return to using other browsers for certain things.)] Beta App Tracker Protection is a big plus.",
      "VPN was easily turned off when I set the option for never disconnect, but this is about the fourth or fifth time, I guess if you don't buy the VPN what can you expect, just a heads up people. And when I sent a message I had to send another before I got a call back at which time some new disclaimer stated that was possible if I was utilizing certain applications , the funny part I was looking at the phone that Was about 2' away and watched it happen, it didn't have anything to do with me!!!",
      "I would give this at 5 stars, except certain tabs just disappear out of nowhere. The back and forward commands don't work appropriately, sometimes when you go back it takes away the option for you to go forward. If you hit back it may even take you to a whole other tab, changing the previous tab creating a situation where you can't find where you just work. Browser history saves nothing, this app was great but it seems kind of buggy now."

Every server is too slow. When you go to refresh servers, it says successful, but no list of servers shown. It's Addie, but almost anything free is these days.",
      "Five stars should be given to this good VPN,it connects quickly And it never disconnects,it is easy to work with and various locations from the number one countries on the internet are important,It also provides and you can easily play online games or run internet apps in the big and strong country of (Iran) where fiber optic network is used and internet speed in Iran is about 6 or 7 GB/S or more,This powerful and good VPN has always helped me tremendously and will continue to do so,Thank you.",
      "It is a good program, but for Iran, it is only activated for one hour and we do not have the possibility to buy the premium version, and this makes us either not use it at all or very little... Good luck, fellow citizens 😁❤🇮🇷",
      "The problem with your app is :every time I am not in use Then I check the app.it says wait to check the net.I main the app is not working at all time.ln that case I shall in the risk of hakers and spy. Could you clarify?",

      "Way too many adds. I tried to follow the instructions on how to upgrade and couldn't locate. I sent an email and to date, no response. The most annoying thing is the connection issue. I have to unplug the TV each day for the app to connect. After that first time, the connection is fine. It's also annoying that the app times out after non use for a minute. To keep having to connect is ridiculous",
      "About every 3rd tap on the remote you have to contend with an add. It's horrible if you are attempting to search for anything! The remote doesn't stay connected so if you need to pause something after it has sat idle for a bit, best of luck to you. The best feature is when the remote is connected, you can turn the TV both on and off. Honestly, that option and the keyboard are the only features that warrant 2⭐s. Otherwise, the lifetime price of $9.99 would've been an overcharge😭",
      "First of all, there was a purchase price for this app. Now it has ads, and not just at the top, it will expand the ad to full screen while you are using it (every 4th click) so that you will open the advertisement and exit what you were doing. It also won't stay connected to any devices after sitting still for a few moments. I've had this for several months (maybe even a year by now) and I don't like it. This one does have a few extra features over free ones but very frustrating to use.",
      "The only good thing about this is that I'm not having to wait for a new remote to be shipped out. I paid 1069 after taxes for the lifetime access to the app there are now more ads on it then whenever I had the free version that only turned the TV on and off and changed the HDMI settings. You can't even search for a show or open an app without a 30-second ad popping up and stopping you from what you were doing. This was definitely a waste of $10",
      "I would give it five stars. I purchased life time. Cause it was one time pay. Which was great. About 5 days after purchase. You went crazy on ads. When you hit rewind or fast forward here comes ads and it doest stop when you hit skip. By then you went way pass where you wanted it to stop. Slow down ads or I'm gonna cancel."
