    "comments": [
      "It's a pretty good platform game and has a lot to offer for free. It has really everything for all ages of people and brings a lot of ideas to the table. However, even though this is the simpler version of Roblox, there's a lot less to experience. Like how mobile players have a limited customization variation for the avatar editor, or less buttons to work with, bad screen crunch and not being able to edit and make games entirely. But if you are able to look past these issues, it's great.",
      "Amazing. It has zero ads, a gazzilion games, and just awesome! So many customization options, and even free items if your cheap. Only complaint I could possibly have is it only works well if you have internet. It works without it, but is super laggy and long loads. But that was expected. Awesome one-stop shop for games! ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!!!!",
      "Great game. It's fun, but there are so many lags. I join a game, and I immediately get disconnected. It takes me about 7 attempts or more to get into the game I want to play, and it takes numerous attempts to even stay connected and I know it is not my internet because I have a full connection. Second, when an item becomes unavailable and you can't wear it, roblox sends a message to your inbox to redeem lost credit, but when I got one, my robux never came back to me, and it's been over 2 months.",
      "One app with a wide variety of games to choose from, has no lag or issues. If you have a kid, definitely recommend it if he/she is above the age of 9. ALSO! 1 small bug I've noticed recently that has been happening is that people's screens are freezing/can't be moved, don't worry, I found a solution! Click the Roblox icon on the top left of your screen (when in a game) and then exit out of the menu and now your screen can move! (if your camera doesn't move at all)",
      "Great app, but there's some issues I'd like to discuss: All hats were, for some reason, just changed to a minimum price of 65 robux? That's almost a dollar per cheapest hat accessory. When looking at Roblox Catalog/Marketplace on mobile, there's no filter for classic clothing. This causes the search results to come up with all 3D models, even when I type in the exact title of a classic shirt. I'm happy with the games, just wanted to bring attention to these issues."

      "It's well designed but it's just another pointless time waster. I was hoping there'd be some sort of strategy like buying properties to compete against other people but it's just completely random. You roll the dice over and over again and get seemingly random quantities of money and then you tap on properties to upgrade them... And that's it. That's the game. That and pop-ups trying to get you to buy more turns and money so you can do more pointless dice rolling and property \"upgrading.\"",
      "It starts off fun. I loved being able to collect and trade stickers to complete the albums. Trading is one of the funnest parts, until you get stuck on needing gold cards that cant be trading unless they do a gold blitz, which they dont always do. It quickly became apparent the game is rigged, nothing is random. Can't stand games that take no skill, then they intentionally make obstacles in order to have to pay them! Poor game design requiring you to pay to win! I think I am done!",
      "Monopoly Go is getting stale, it needs a larger variety of mini games. The same 2 mini games for almost a year is criminal. Cash grab as a timed event? Wth? That is not worth it, it should be a mini game for the railroad. Don't waste your time on this game if you expect something new and refreshing. It's the same thing over and over again. No new major changes.",
      "It was fun in the beginning. The farther you get in the game the more it takes to finish a board. No matter how much it costs to finish a round you only get 50 dice in return. Stickers are more difficult to get and it costs too many rolls to get anything on the top rewards. Partner events are harder to get points for as well. I'm very close to giving up on this game altogether.",
      "Been playing this game about a year. They fixed the trading so that you can trade in game which is great. The only thing is the likelihood of landing on special tiles is so low. I understand it's a free game and they bank on people spending money because let's face it this is a gambling addiction crutch. But come on.. I have lost so many events and being so close and getting nothing. It's frustrating, yet addicting."

      "The game is fine so far. A very non intrusive tutorial pointing you in the right direction and nice art. So far no real gameplay which is a bummer. Personally, I would like to see a mode where you have to manually control your units to choose their attacks, for example hard difficulty raids. The free draws are actually in the game, although not to the extent you may want. You get x10 summons free per day, which is better than any other game I've seen offering those \"10,000 draws\" which is a lie.",
      "I've been waiting for this game to leave beta for a while, and saw an ad for it about a week before it launched. The art style had changed for the better by a lot, but I could still recognize its soul as being the same game, even with its name being different. 10/10 great unit collector, beautiful art, the premise isn't anything groundbreaking, but its executed well, and I like the story so far",
      "So far, the game is great! The colors and art are nice to look at, especially the designs of the characters.. The story progression is decent and even though this game has a lot of microtransactions, they don't shove it in your face like other games! (Yay) only thing about it is that the story is kinda generic but that's just me lol great game",
      "3d AFK arena clone with less features and even more monetization options for your own enjoyment. At least there aren't any adds but plenty of popup packages that randomly show up and conveniently have the buy button where the 'accept rewards' button is on the activity they are on. A lot of micromanaging too instead of a pure idle game. Disappointed as I was looking forward to this games theme.",
      "Enjoy it very much. It's easy and not too hard . Monster designs r cute, cool, or all the above. I don't like the Gacha system much, but at least it's not too bad to where I can't get good monsters🙂 I will also add that hopefully in future updates the monsters can evolve into different forms when they reach a certain level. Would love to see wat type of designs u guys could come up with if u guys wanted to do that🤩"

It was trying to saw me stuff and it was just a really bad game. It didn't even have any interactive stuff. It was just left or right, but the alphabet's remained cute and it was like 2D, but not 2. The the elevations were really bad. It's just a bad game overall. Never act alive for Eddie Wong.It was just a little weird and I'm not inappropriate.....",
      "This game is as advertised, but it has advertisements very frequently. I spent probably 70% - 80% of the time watching ads and about 7% of the time clicking the arrow down on ads in this game. You can not play it offline as it will not let you. Love the artwork, but it's not worth the plethora of ads.",
      "So it's a good game but the only problem is THE ADDS COME UP LATERALY EVER 2-4 SECONDS.It could be just little pop ups or full on adds and even if you say no to an offer it plays them,so I would recommend just watching the add.Other that that thought it's a good game and I like the music, regardless of what other people say.",
      "The game itself seems fun, however it's incredibly difficult to actually play when the ads on the bottom of the screen continually pop up to cover half of the screen. Not like a regular pop up, but worse. In addition to actual pop up ads. \"Game\" is 85% ads. Deleting immediately.",
      "Installed game, launched game, loading bar filled and completed, you'd think that means gameplay well you'd be wrong I got an ad immediately after the game loaded didn't even get to try the game before I got an ad. Tried to play offline to avoid ads since most games allow that. But this one for some reason doesn't. Says some things unavailable offline please check connection. So forced to have ads in this malware disguised as a \"game\"."

      "The game and idea of it is fun and great but there is too many problems. I even purchased a small beginner's pack to start off 20 level and to remove ads. Still hard to play and beat any levels. There's a bad error now that U can't even use the magnet. If U run into the magnet it's supposed to automatically scoop up anything within a certain radius of U but since a about a week ago it doesn't even work and actually now glitches to where U can't pick ANYTHING up with the magnet. Disappointing!",
      "Multiple problems, 1. There are so many ads after you win or die. 2. It's so hard to win because somehow people are reaching lvl 100 in 10 to 15 seconds and you barely can eat others. 3. When you get to the next bos level, there is less lvl ball things than there is in the 1st boss level. 4. It's so hard to get higher than the bosses level. It's a very fun game tho. 3/10",
      "Game is fun, but all the ads suck the fun right out of it. Unfortunately I'm Uninstaller due to excessive ads. If you're defeated it asks if you want to watch an ad for a multiplier of the points for that play, even if you click no thanks it forces you to watch an ad anyway. Why bother asking?? Take the amount of ads down a notch or two, and I will love to reinstall and update my rating.",
      "I really like this game there are lots of ads but you can get out of them easily just close the app and re open it but don't shut out the app just click out and back on and the ads are gone it takes less then 5 seconds to do that the only reason I am giving it four stars is because it does get annoying sometimes I would give it three/3 stars it really needs to update but I have only been playing it for a day and overall it's fun I am on like level 5 or 6 so far so yeah it's fun overall!",
      "Too many ads, considering it stops MID play to watch the same ad from the lady 40 times. The upgrades are terrible, buy one and you have to watch an ad, and when you do watch it, it doesn't upgrade. The bosses are too difficult and there's not enough time to play a single round. I always get the same exact Highscore of 1140, and never does it get higher!"

      "It's a fun game & I'm enjoying the challenges of play. I level completed both the Bronze and Silver Levels in only 3 days, but I'm not getting bumped up to the gold level to play. Why not? This game also has a lot of ADs (up to 1 minute long) which I paid to have removed, yet I'm still seeing ads. UGH! But if I'm not going to be bumped up to play further levels, I want my ADs money back since I'll no longer be playing this game...",
      "The ads ARE annoying, but for most of them, you can skip through if you catch the forward tab on the upper left first. In terms of gameplay, it was cool for a while, but I kept wondering why i was trying to win the tournaments. It's for coins, helicopters or hints that I don't need. Races are impossible to win if you don't go ad free. There needs to be...more to the game, something to retain interest, to work towards. It's a good pick up game when you're bored, but otherwise...eh 🤷",
      "Just started playing because it looked good to keep my brain active.. it's exactly that! Love it so far!! At Level 26 I noticed at the top, \"Moves: 4\" OMGosh, got nervous and started messing up, but on track; don't think about it! Ads per most games, but you can \"X\" out of them. Love that if you crash, you don't have to start over completely (so far). I'll see how it goes and maybe update later. Keeps your brain active, not just another \"pass the time\" game. So far, absolutely recommend!",
      "This game is really challenging and you know a good time passer but the ads are insane after you get to level seven or eight they play an ad after every single level. I get the concept of playing ads to get boosters that's great that's a choice. having to watch a 30-second ad after every two to three minute game is absolutely insane. I understand that's how they make it free play but they need to make the ads optional. I will be deleting. The ads are CRAZY an a deterrent from enjoymemt.",
      "The problem with ALL these games. More time is spent viewing ads than playing the game!! I've been hit with so many ads/pop-ups and redirects I've actually lost where my game was! You have to be in the right headspace for these games cuz the inundation of the ads will make you want to drop kick your computer catapult your laptop and throw your droid at the wall!! NO!!! Seriously! OH yeah your opt out of receiving adds works the exact opposite of what you want. You guys ask for our emails so you"

      "THIS GAME IS SOOOOO ADDICTING!!!!!! I've literally played this game all night and there is two awesome versions. the adventure and the regular game and both are super fun and challenging as you keep playing. Plus a bonus game when you go to settings and hit more games that's also super cool and Tetris like. And there is no ads except when you run out of space and want to revive. Then you watch a short ad. I cannot recommend this game enough!!!",
      "This game is literally so fun. If you are stressed it is the perfect way to calm down and relax. The only this is that it has ads, always containing ads after you play the game and run out of space. Also, I had to close out the game before it gave me the ad, and when I logged back in, it gave me the ad!",
      "Small 9x9 board, hige blocks; game ends abruptly at odd pre-determined score level so ads can be served. lots of play stalls. unchallenging/boring. Sometimes restarts with an already-full board, gives a \"no spaces available\" message, anx jumps immed. into another 2nd repeat ad. Too much waiting time. Avoid. I uninstalled.",
      "Started out great. Loved figuring out strategy. However, now am getting frustrated with the ads. There are 2 types that ruin the game completely...goes to a black screen and can't do anything but get out and start all over, and the other one is the video commercials that go to a gray screen with 'learn more' in center of screen then a small x finally shows up on corner. No matter how many times you tap the x nothing happens. If you keep tapping it eventually will go back to the game.",
      "Fun but problematic. The gameplay is fine, but the ads keep messing it up. Some ads will just be a black screen, no getting out of it. so I have to exit and wait a bit before I can play again. I've encountered a few ads that never have a x option, so again, I have to close the game and wait. If they get better ads, I'll bump up the stars because it really is a fun game."

      "This game is HORRIBLE! The amount of ads during my game play is just so annoying. In the ad for the game itself, you have plenty of options for outfits and it seems like there's much more to do. However, you literally always get the same hairs, same outfits, and the bot is always picking the wrong stuff. So, it's not even a challenge.",
      "A game made simply to soak up ad revenue from bots and bored folk. No level select and after level 60 the levels begin to repeat. The goofy body modification is barely touched throughout the \"game\" so even playing it ironically just to laugh at the ridiculousness isn't worth the constant ad interruption every 20 seconds. If you're gonna make a trash ad grab game then at least go all out with the goofy body mods and allow folks a level select.",
      "I give it a three because the first two levels they Don't have ADS then. Afternoon's first, who is starts to have ADS. Adds, then I look at the comments and then I thought it would be way worse. And they give you a specific one you have to do. Do not download this at all!!",
      "I would rate this a 0. They gave me ADS every 2 seconds when I downloaded this app. I thought I was gonna be able to make my own outfit. They gave me outfits to fake and if I didn't complete that complete them. I would have failed. So I showed my friends this game. They got annoyed at it. I would not recommend downloading this I also got annoyed.",
      "Sometimes there's ads that forcedly open a new window and when you come back the game resets, so you lost all the rewards and watched multiple ads in vain. Plus the last boyfriend (Fred from Scooby-Doo?) isn't on the boyfriends tab, so the moment you switch him for other you literally lose him forever and can't use him anymore nor get him again. Not the worst game ever but still not worth it at ALL, don't waste your time downloading"

      "The game is addicting but it's almost impossible to play more then a couple rounds at a time due to the cost of each round and the amount they reward makes it impossible to get ahead unless you spend a lot of money! Your rewards don't always get credited I noticed on one of the trails the trail present that I landed on didn't credit me and that wasn't the first time! I love the graphics & the character!",
      "Fun game but set up to make you lose!!! The game itself is really cute with great graphics but it is ridiculous how much to pay to play a level and the game is set up to where you almost HAVE to buy coins to be able to play for a decent amount of time. It is ridiculous that I have it down to one or two tiles left to get rid of and 10 spare dominoes to change and none of them match and you lose the level. I really enjoy playing it but can't seem to play that much. Do not recommend",
      "Any good review of this game is fake or from a in game review popup for credits within the first 10 levels. Once you reach level 70 it's all down hill from there, you cannot progress any further without spending astronomical amounts of money. It's like a switch and very obvious. I blew through $8.99 (120,000 coins) In just the 8 levels following level 70. Following level 80 you will not even get halfway through a single level. This game is the definition of a bait and switch scam.",
      "Luck Based and Pay-to-win. I ran out of coins, so it's hard to make any progress at level 120 or so, at chapter 5. The game itself is mostly luck based. Even the few times where you have a choice of more than 1 possible move, the best move is random. Oh, and every time I open the app, there's 8 pop-ups for random deals that I have to close!",
      "This game was fun and exciting but now I am on level 10 and it takes up to 20 stars which cost 20 games to complete one task and even that would not be so bad if it gave you the opportunity to win after 5 times playing. It seems to cause you ultimately to have to spend money on the tokens needed to play the game. You can finally win if you play long enough. I do, however, like the updated trail, and I look forward to other ideas that will make it great"

      "This game is addictive, simple, and cute to play! An amazing game to play if you wanna pass by time. I love that it's customizable and there are just so many things you can do! Although the one thing that is bringing it down to a 3 star is that if you wanna change servers to play with a friend or leave a toxic world, you have to start all over. It's very sad and annoying. It would be a 5-atar if you could change servers and keep your progress.",
      "The devs allow this game to reduce the volume of all your other apps without your permission and it's mandatory. Also, who thought it was a good idea to have your mushroom evolve into an anime human not even that far into the game? So lame.",
      "As a new game there's still lots to change and adjust. This game is actually good, I enjoy the customization options! Really cute lol. But something you need, gold, exp need to drop from enemies no matter what. You get stuck and the only way is by summons to get gold and exp. You get stuck and you have to wait til a reset. As I'm having to replay a stage because I can't beat the boss I'm literally stuck...no gold, xp or lamps drop. Change those and push more content and this game is great!",
      "Pay to play basically, and 95% pay to win so don't waste your time trying this game. To progress you're almost required to spend money. The events are 90% pay to participate. Good luck completing the 7 Day trial challenges without spending. The level progression is trash as well and instead of basing it off of enemies you're killing its based off of items recieved which come at a slow rate so you're more likely to pay to progress.",
      "Game advertises as idle, but it isn't. You power up by equipment. Which you must open 1 lamp/box at a time. There is a shake animation, then you compare stats and decide to sell or equip. You get a lamp for each area you beat, and 4 for each boss area, among other ways. Your idle time that you are aware also generates lamps. So you are stuff just looking at a screen of equipment for like 75% of the game. Your game won't progress unless you rinse and repeat the repetitive animations."

    "comments": [
      "Each level has 2-3 puzzles, first a very easy one, then more difficult. If you fail the more difficult puzzle, you start the level over from the beginning, meaning you have to replay the easy one before it will even let you retry the hard one. Replaying the same puzzles over and over is very annoying and boring. There's also a time limit on each level, but they don't give you enough time. You can watch an ad for more time, but the game already too many ads. More ads than game time.",
      "Too many ads. Fun little time waster ruined by yet another developer that thinks \"how many ads per minute\" rather than \"how many ads per player\". Step 1, make the game fun, step 2 monitize without completely ruining step 1. The extra bolt, daily bonuses, undo button, ect should be a great source without the player feeling like its forced. 2 stars instead of 1 because forced ads are the short type.",
      "The game is fun, but i have two issues. One the number of ads is obnoxious. Especially the ones that are a 30 second video, than a mandatory interactive screen, then another static streen after. Two, the difficulty of the levels is usually well calibrated, but I took issue with hidden screw holes since you can't plan for them on the first try. The level feels too very difficult until you randomly come across a screw hole that was hidden by a board that you wouldnt have thought to move.",
      "It would be good if it didn't have two separate levels in one, putting the easy first and hard last. I just play this game for the hard puzzles, and it's very annoying having to completely reset right after almost finishing the puzzle onto something I have finished 50 times. It makes the game feel very repetitive and gets worse after getting hit with something like, \"Spend a ticket or watch an ad to undo one move,\" as I just want to play the game to have fun, not spend time watching ads for it.",
      "Game is super fun. Ads are absolutely ridiculous. They are 45-60 seconds long (or more) and required constantly, so many it actually inhibits gameplay. If the ads were shorter, it wouldn't be bad, but they are 35 seconds, then 15 seconds, then 5 seconds, then 5 more seconds, then 3 seconds....EACH AD. I get it, the devs want us to pay for ad free. There's a line that keeps free players playing AND ad revenue flowing, but they've crossed it."

      "It was great! So much fun, and so satisfying. I would love to give this a five star, but unfortunately there were a couple bugs I found. Often when there would be an add, it would freeze and go dark. The only way it would unfreeze was when I swiped out of the app, that made me lose all my progress on the map I was just on. It also wouldn't give me the percent that I had gotten before it froze. Its not too big of a deal, but that was why it couldn't be a five star.",
      "Don't believe anyone else's reviews. I DELETED this game after just an hour playing it. The Insane amount of ADs on this game ruins it. When an ad appears every 30 seconds and gives you a \"No Thank You\" option, but when you click it, it just sends you to another ad... So what's the purpose of it. So unless you pay for No ADs, this game is unbearable. It's nothing like the website!",
      "This game Would be fun if it wasn't for the \"Break time\" ads in the middle of a game. I swear, they give you like 2 of these things right when I'm trying not to get my trail get cut off by another player which I think are bots. I die usually after these things and they could definitely give me as many ads they want after a round of me trying to win. Please fix this as it is very very annoying. Thank you",
      "It's a good game it just has a lot of ads. For example, when I start a new place on a map and I get at least 3 kills, it plays an ad. Also, it gets kind of boring when you get all the skins except legendary ones (the ones you have to use real money for ), and they don't really ad in new ones like I think the game would be a little bit better if they had a bigger choice of skins for this game.",
      "Far too many ads, the ads itself just doesn't make any sense. I'm not saying a game shouldn't have them but these ads just feel forceful. As soon as you kill three players you're hit with an ad about some power up, it doesn't even matter if you decline it or not either. The game itself is fun! (Cool updates!) but the ads just ruin everything for it. I'd prefer the older version of this game, at least they didn't shove ads down your throat"

      "25 turns to break 120 objects that take 2 matches next to it to break it. 240/25 = a minimum of six matches next to breakable objects each turn. Don't even get me started on the mail boxes or magic hats. Good clean fun for about 400 levels then it's pay or wait out the RNG. You will eventually win any level even without using power ups or money, I hardly ever do, but get ready to just lose a bunch till it gives you a pity win for certain levels.",
      "To be honest ..I love this game BUT.. IN order to move forward and get to the highest levels you have to spend a lot of money it's crazy. You don't get enough coins rewards for each level you bit,but if you lose ..you have to pay 900 coins firts try,1900 second ,and like that increasing untill you end up broke and have to buy more coins .",
      "ADD \"MOVE REWIND\" - My name is Aaron this is a great game! I like playing it a lot there's a few things that could improve but I'm just hoping one of them could be adding like a \"MOVE REWIND\" let's say you make a move and you messed up by accidentally tapping the screen or just didnt like the way things played out, you can then use you power up \"MOVE REWIND\" and try again.",
      "The game is called FREE with in-app purchases. You're gonna get to levels that require power ups in order to pass. That said, the power ups don't work every time. For example, the dynamite keg plus rocket is supposed to launch 3 rockets both horizontally and vertically. Well, only 1 rocket gets counted on these larger targets. That's just one example. Device type doesn't seem to matter for this complaint. It's either a built in scam, or they never did a beta test.",
      "I really enjoyed the game at first. However, the higher your level gets the more impossible it is to pass those levels unless you pay for more coins to help. I can tell you I've spent several times trying to pass certain levels without paying and I almost always end up getting 1 more hit and I would have completed the level. I like complex games but it takes the fun out of it sometimes when you have do the same level so many time or pay to progress."

      "My kids and I love this game and gace had it for a long time, payed for no adds. And have a Tom over level 60. But I give 1 star because here the past couple days. The fly points wont go up past 102. And the mini/ bonas games wont load at all. It is upsetting because The worm/ snake game 8s the only thing i really like to do. And it wont load. I have uninstalled it and reinstalled it amd it wont work right. Please please fix this glitch?",
      "I used to play this game as a child. It had a feature where it was hard to get some super rare items, and it took time to get them. I would spend hours hoping to get them and I would miss being able to show my rare items to my friends. Now they had an update where every item has no rarity and costs 3-10 coins. It's incredibly boring now since there's not reason to play for rarity.",
      "The game is cool and a lot better than My Talking Tom, except for in terms of clothes, accessories and decorations. Wish there were more selection in these categories. The mini games are also cooler. Except for the controls in Space Trail. They're extremely wonky and the snake is hard to control. I also don't like getting duplicate cards. So to recap: More clothes, accessories, decorations, get rid of the chances of getting duplicates, and fix the controls in Space Trail, and I'll rate higher. Also, the game keeps crashing and freezing to the point were I have to exit out.",
      "So far, my daughter loves the game. However, I'm noticing when we have the option to spin the wheel, she never gets more than 20 or 30 airplanes or 5-10 coins. I watch ad after ad trying to get extra spins to try to earn things for her and I get the same results. I can see every few spins getting the lowest prize, but every single time? This is very frustrating.",
      "It's a good game for the most part. But there should be more variety of mini games, even the ones from the original My Talking Tom would do. The mini games are bland in my opinion. I like the concept of Tom having his own pet, but each of them should have a different voice. I like the idea of using a plane to get gifts, but getting coins and stars can be difficult. I would recommend adding coins to mini games with the plane fuel. There should also be a larger variety of clothing for Tom."

      "Seems a near perfect clone of the original, and doesn't give me an upcoming loss of support warning (so maybe that won't be an issue later?) I turn my Internet off before playing so I get zero ads. I do miss out on online play this way, but I got it for the offline sandbox experience, and online play is only a later afterthought. Works perfectly for me, played it for hours on my first go, happy for more soon.",
      "This game is okay but there is way too ads and me and my brother tried to play but there was so many ads we can't even see each other for like at least 10 without being disturbed by the freaking ads I do not like it's an okay but if you're going to do adventures or something like do not download this game cuz this is not for you!!! that's just me!! That's why I give 3 stars but I would give it 3in a half if I could!!!",
      "Seems like a good game, but I can't really say for sure because every 15 seconds another ad interrupts, and then it sends me back to the loading screen. I wasn't even able to look at the settings without ads interrupting. If you are looking for a game to play then don't download this one. If you are looking for advertisement then this is the one you want.",
      "I love how crazy how good it actually is. I just downloaded a random thing to use for a 3d graph for drawing. But when I opened it to us it it's was just like minecraft (had minecraft before just deleted it by accident). Three stars not for the ads cause I can live with them, but for the fact that every time I click out of them it brings me back to the loading screen kinda obnoxious",
      "It looks like Minecraft with some odd textures for things like stone. The only reason for the poor review is the ads. First time I used it, I played for a few hours without any ads, but ever since I have been getting about an ad a minute. I think it would be better if they set it up where you have a set number of ads when you start a new world, come back from a different screen, or open the command bar. If that doesn't happen, I might declare the game unplayable. 7/8/2022. Deleting. Unplayable."

      "not bad. fun distracting time killer. Update: Changing from four to two stars. Well, after four days, not so much fun now. After only about 10 levels it's getting exponentially difficult to the point I cannot advance. Uninstalling rather than waste more time on a futal effort. A sheer genius might be able to keep playing, but that's a very tiny group, and they probably aren't wasting time playing games.",
      "Decent time killer. It's pretty simple, match the tiles of the same color to remove a spot and to win the game. I like the fact that there are minimal ads, but you can watch ads to win rewards instead of using coins. Speaking of which, coins seem to be easy to use up and perhaps a little harder to gain. I only gave 4 stars because even though I know I haven't gotten to hard levels yet, I think there should be more challenging levels.",
      "A fun game absolutely destroyed by invasive ads. Put ads between the levels, fine. But to have ads without any way to turn off their volume, or ads that jump you to the Play Store every time you try to close them, it's beyond infuriating, it's insulting. It's forcing the player's hand. Give me an ad. Make me watch it for 5, 10, even 15 seconds. But do not give an ad that forces open the store three times in a row before it even gives you the option to close it. Worst ad algorithm I've ever seen.",
      "Excellent game, extremely entertaining, and easy to pick up. I would give it 5 stars but I have one issue with it. The cost for removing ads is $7.99 which is pretty steep. I went ahead and paid it because I love this game and want to be able to play it more on my breaks. The $7.99 ad removal only removes the ads that pop up at the start of each level. It does not remove the ads that you have to watch to open up the free spaces or power ups. For $7.99 it should remove all ads, not just some.",
      "Not as difficult as some people are making it out to be - challenging at times but definitely fair. Simple to play game that doesn't feel like it was made for a 2yr old. Don't mind the ads too much because they're in between levels but it getting kinda annoying when they're long and unskippable. Still better than most free to play games out there now."

    "comments": [
      "Good game, it's fun, teaches about timing, but one of my downfalls of this game is whenever my battery is the slightest bit low like about 10%-5% it starts getting really glitchy, to the point where I will be dead but the music is still playing. And yes I have done everything, I've reset my phone, I've cleared storage, I've been in a 100% working Internet environment, and it still does not work. Still a good game I would recommend and if you don't have the same problem as me then Its a nice game",
      "The ads can get a little annoying at times but are very minimal and don't interrupt your gameplay. One issue is the auto checkpoints, often I will use them in practice and it will spawn right before a spike or during a jump, so every time I respawn, I die. I've tried turning it off and placing checkpoints myself, but it's too hard to do while multitasking. It would be nice to have pre-placed checkpoints for every level.",
      "The game is good except \"Dash.\" The level Dash keeps lagging on the ship and a little bit after the ship into the robot for a short period of time, I can't fix this problem because the settings won't help. I don't know why the ship is making my phone lag but I just want to be able to play the level lag free. Another thing is, that all the new levels are insane difficulty, I think it would be better to have lower difficulty levels so we can have more levels each update than just one single level.",
      "even though this isn't the full version of geomatry dash, it's still amazing. With more levels than meltdown and subzero, and there are more difficult levels to vary. I would consider getting this if you don't want to buy the full version. The music is a absolute banger. The only thing that I do not like is the ads. It's literally every time you die a couple times or when you beat the level. I don't know if geomatry dash can do this, but please add more demon levels. I really enjoy club step!!!",
      "a great skill game, you have meny levels to play and can get cool things, by doing challenges like new colors and new characters. it's really good but stressful if you don't have good practice. it's also fun to uninstall the game and reinstall it so you can get stuff again. the ads are annoying but easy to stop, just go offline before you enter the game. it's also nice to record the music of the levels. and there's no inappropriate stuff, and it's really fun try it yourself!! so five stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

      "A super fun game to play during your free time and works with and without internet. Love the music, the new seasons, and the characters you can unlock for every new season. It keeps the game gripping and entertaining. However, it can get super irritating to update it every time you change seasons. Overall, it's great and I highly recommend it.",
      "I love this game. It's an instant classic. The endless running, the new locales, the incredible visuals... My only criticisim is I wish there was a way to just play classic subway surfers with no world tour. Don't get me wrong, I love the World tour, it's just... I want a taste of nostalgia for once. Other than that, God tier.",
      "Great game, the season events keep things fresh and exciting. However, it's annoying that players have to wait for each tier of season hunt rewards to unlock. What's the point of collecting tokens if you have to wait? It makes the entire process feel boring, and cheap. Let players have access to rewards as soon as they earn them so they can actually enjoy the accomplishment.",
      "I love all the characters in the game and how challenging it get thru out the run. It's very entertaining 😁 I just don't like how it can be slow sometimes. It sometimes doesn't let me watch the add to get my prise, even if I have full bars. And I have to get to x8 speed just to go to the next level on something...If this gets fixed,then it will probably be a 5.",
      "I used to play subway surfer when it first came out, but this new Verizon is updated and it's amazing. The graphics 10/10, Characters 10/10, music 10/10. Overall everything about this game is good. Yeah it has ads but so you can get things, like power ups and such. And I believe you can play off line I haven't tried yet but for ads off line, you won't be able to do anything. But you can still play the game if you don't have wi-fi you just have limited stuff."

      "Irritating! First, let's just say the game itself is not bad. The graphics are ok. The questions are not extremely hard. It would be enjoyable but it is so very irritating to watch an ad after every single question! The ads are longer than the actual game time, totally ridiculous. And then the ad freezes and you have to restart the game. I'm not sure why this got so high of a review. I understand ads are necessary but not like this. I will be deleting this game.",
      "Decided to come back and update my comments. I actually enjoy this game. Sometimes I get wrong answers when I'm not paying close enough attention re: names 🙃....it is amazing the things I have actually learned while playing this game. One thing for sure I wish they would get rid of Harry Potter, Friends and a few other shows. I never ever watched any of these two shows but I lose quite frequently when I'm asked questions about these 2 shows which seems to come up quite a bit. Bleh 😵.",
      "Fun game. It has issues though. Ads play at full volume unless each is muted separately. Makes it hard to play in, say, a doctor's office. Ads also crash the game at an alarming rate. Scree just goes black & locks up. When you restart you lose your previous progress. I'm ok with it because I'm just playing for the questions. If you really want to advance in the game this will frustrate you no end.",
      "I really wanted to like this. Two bad things within the first 5 minutes. 1 - I turned the sound and music off in settings as I like yo play at work, but when the first add came on it blew out the speaker so everyone could hear. 2 - with that loud ad it also stuck me in some weird loop switching between the ad and the app store. Sorry folks but this is a loser.",
      "I enjoy trivia and this would've been a nice app if not for the constant ads. Every 3 questions then an ad that takes longer than the question round itself. The ads have no mute so it's sudden blaring sounds. I don't want to turn down my phone's volume, and the game settings only apply to the game not the ads. Uninstalling because of the annoying ads not the game itself."

      "The game is constantly disconnecting, even after uninstall reinstall. My home wifi is stable, the game is unstable. It's next to unplayable. Not to mention the number of micro transactions, there are so many. You can not get legendary heroes for free. They need to add a way to limit who can join your rally. You should be able to block players under a certain power from joining when you are trying to fight a big monster. It's almost impossible to kick w/ rejoining. There are no ads at least.",
      "The graphics are nice, pretty polished. The ux is cluttered, and there are tons of things to click on and lots of ways to spend money... BUT, the actual game play is boring as hell. It's so basic and automatic that it takes ZERO thought or skill. You slide your little people left and right, and THAT'S IT. You don't even have to think. You just move them to the blue lane. It feels super non-interactive for as busy as it is. Feels like a weak attempt to disguise the money pit it's drooling to be.",
      "The game is cool and fun to play. The reason for the 3 stars is the extremely long time it takes to build/upgrade. If you plan on playing this game w/ no money or minimal money spent, I wouldn't waste my time. Taking 2, 3, 4+ days to upgrade a building or training soldiers is wild. You spend more time waitin for upgrades/training than playing. I feel the building/training speed could be decreased so ppl spend more time playin rather than waiting. Will change my review if this improves.",
      "Fun game but highly predatory constantly pushes \"deals\" or \"value buys\" in your face with no way to turn those things off. It's game with pay to win mechanics that has a free to play option, which makes being able to participate in the events of the game impossible. By the time a free to play player is able to do anything, most of the people they know will have left the game and moved on. Would give less stars if I could",
      "The screenshots of the game (what's shown in ads) is probably less than 5% of the game. And it's no where near what they show. Main game is building a base behind artificial time gates. You can play for a couple of hours before you are forced to a halt behind long build times and progress becomes non existent unless you pay for boosts."
