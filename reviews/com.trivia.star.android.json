It would be enjoyable but it is so very irritating to watch an ad after every single question! The ads are longer than the actual game time, totally ridiculous. And then the ad freezes and you have to restart the game. I'm not sure why this got so high of a review. I understand ads are necessary but not like this. I will be deleting this game.",

You have the option occasionally to watch an ad for extra points, which I will do, but the forced ads in these games gets excessive and takes you out of the game. An uninstall for me.",
