Even if you are solving the puzzles perfectly, the physics on the wood will cause them to fall super slow, blocking the holes you need to complete the stage. Each stage is timed, so once the timer runs out you have to pay to for more time, or watch an ad. You also have to pay to redo the level....yeah a hard uninstall for me.
