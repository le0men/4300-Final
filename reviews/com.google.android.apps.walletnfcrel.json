I have also just changed phones I was using a Huawei Mate 20 and have just recently updated to using Pixel 7 Pro. Having great difficulty adding (and saving) my cards. I have also tried on multiple occasions to pay using Google pay and just will not recognise the NFC (which is configured and on). Based in Australia 😥",

EDIT: I'm clueless as to why the app could add my card just fine but didn't function on first installation; after reinstalling and troubleshooting, nothing seems to have changed but it works now.",

I cannot even delete and re-add the cards as the \"delete\" option is also under history ..",
