      "text": "UPDATE : 4/24/2022. I love dg digital coupons. When I first started using the app it would lag consistently. I could never connect to Dg wifi. Now it's doing much better. It still gets my prices wrong on some things, like it's a glitch in the system that shows prices wrong or sometimes it will just show $0.00 and when I go to pay for it, it shows the actual price. Other than that ,it's essentially a great app , and a must have this day in time.",

After I do all my shopping and get it rang up and I have done my part with putting my phone number in and the clerk get my total only for it to say they were declined. It is not just mine, I had my husband stop at dollar general to get some things and his did the same thing. This has been for 2 weeks or so. I have logged out and back in, I have Uninstalled it and reinstalled oh and it asked me to update again. Still the same thing. The clerks have no idea about the Digital Coupons and they have no idea who to contact. I have in the past tried to contact them over my digital app months ago and it was for managers. I have no idea what else to do, but shop somewhere else. I use to love it and used it several times a week. Hope they fix it soon.",

This app is SO FRUSTRATING for Android! I like to be able to scan items in store because the scanned price and shelf price often don't match. However I am completely unable to change the store location to get a correct price. This is a huge problem because I visit over 5 stores in my area and prices vary widely! I am able to search for a store and select a store. It brings up a screen where I can get directions and it shows me hours. However at the bottom of that screen where iPhone users see \"make this my preferred store\" my screen cuts off and I cannot scroll down and click on that selection. This is a really critical updated that needs fixed ASAP or you need to help me out with a solution for this. I have the latest app update (I uninstalled and reinstalled) and I have restarted my phone. Please help.",

RIGHT...You can add 4, 5, and 6 and it will give lower price for those but not the first three. DG needs to figure this out and fix. Also, still cannot add a second payment method in the app.",
