We've yet to cash out any rewards, but we're both actively testing several games for the app. I really like the simplicity of the app, although I would suggest done improvements to the UI. Overall it's easy to use, but there are some difficulties navigating until you've figured it out. The whole thing feels like a quickly made browser, which is fine, because you spend the majority of your time off the app grinding out the games. Thanks for the app",

The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the fact tht u have to make in-app purchases at the end of some tasks to get the full payout but it's only about $5 to complete the task and they reimburse u",
