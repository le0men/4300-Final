      "text": "Re: the Sam's Club App. With the app I can check my local Sam's Club prices and availability on many items in the Club, then make my Shopping List, all right on the app on my phone ! Then when I'm shopping the Club I like to use Scan & Go, - so easy ! I like that I can shop at Sam's Club ON LINE, as well, through the app. On the app, I can ALSO check my account balance at any time, get monthly statement information, pay the bill, get my credit score, etc. ... All in one app !!!",
