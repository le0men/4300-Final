Made the transaction with no issues and the money was transferred really fast. Attempted to do a second transaction an hour later, the fee was there this time which was expected, but now the exchange rate was 1usd=49pesos. They are hiding additional fees within the exchange rate. Better off using Wise or World Remit.",

To Mexico, they charge $4 in fees on top of a reduced exchange rate, so for small dollar remittances ($100 for example), you could easily be paying 8-9% in fees if you send Express with lost purchasing power. If you transfer $500 or more, they waive the $4 fee which if it's feasible, I highly recommend - Instead of sending $100 a month, send $500 every 5 months as you will save $20 in fees.",

Us WU or similar, they do not have these unnecessary delays, especially if you are sending money with urgency. You are not warned in Advance you may experience such a delay. Truly Disappointing service.",
