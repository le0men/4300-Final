And yes I have done everything, I've reset my phone, I've cleared storage, I've been in a 100% working Internet environment, and it still does not work. Still a good game I would recommend and if you don't have the same problem as me then Its a nice game",

One issue is the auto checkpoints, often I will use them in practice and it will spawn right before a spike or during a jump, so every time I respawn, I die. I've tried turning it off and placing checkpoints myself, but it's too hard to do while multitasking. It would be nice to have pre-placed checkpoints for every level.",

There's also not many ads which makes me happy because you don't get interrupted while playing. The only thing I suggest is on the practice mode, keep it the same like how where you leave off you respawn, but add the actual song that goes with the level. Overall, I really think this game is good and it is great to play when you're bored!",

In addition I dislike that the music changes when you go into practice mode because I like the normal music. But the game is very fun and engaging. I highly reccomend Geometery Dash games.

What kept me coming back is the outstanding soundtrack with a mix of EDM, techno, and dubstep, genres that I don't usually care for.",

The reason I gave it a four star review is because sometimes when I tap on the screen, my character either doesn't jump, or jumps late. THis is very annoying when you're very far into a level and it doesn't jump and gets you killed. Other than this, the game is amazing and I totally recomend downloading it.",

      "text": "I could play this gams for hours. And i have. Its really fun. I like to play it with friends too. Its fun to watch even if you fail. It is also an offline game so you can play it on long car rides and such. And it doesn't give you an option to skip if you wath an ad which is for the best. If you need the option to watch an ad to skip a level then you are too athetic to play this game. My piont is, you can turn off wifi andplay withot ads. I highly recomend this game!",

And I know it's supposed to a game of faith timing practice and consecration but you can at least make some check points and make it a little easier for the people who just start as a beginner I just think sometimes it can be a little too hard for people and they quit so if you could do that ty.😆❤️😄",

Plus, if you turn off data and wifi it completely gets rid of ads and you can have an amazing experience with this game. I wish I could afford the full version! This is great!",

Two, I'm playing in the middle of a level, and the game just pauses on it's own to show me the tiniest of ads, and it messes me up everytime. There are almost no video ads, but I would much rather prefer those than the ones that literally pause your game while you're playing.",

And this game is challenging, but that is what makes it good so if you dont like challenges, dont play, and those of who complain, seriously, maybe you shouldn't have installed it because the purpose is to have a challenge. So i overall recomend this game😊",
