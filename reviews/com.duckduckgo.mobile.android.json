The 2 times it stopped I was alerted immediately so I could turn it back on with a simple slide button. Very happy with this software. It has blocked thousands of attempts and when you see how many and where they come from it's staggering. This rating is for my cell phone, although I do have DDG on my desktop as well. Thanks",

In other words, the logo for website \"A\" is also used for \"B\", \"C\" and \"D\". Blocking ads is great but the subsequent battery drain? Not so much.",

BUT it prevented streaming music / radio shortly after the phone went dark. No idea what had been causing the issue and it was driving me nuts. Found out by pure chance. Anyway, that system needs to be sorted to allow the user toggle apps for background web access.",

First, you have no means to decide what type of cookies to accept. Second, there is no setting for declining pre-loading - so I don't have a clue what cookies the app is sending or receiving. Third, all reviews I've read concur that this app has little or no defence against malicious attacks. Hmm ... Uninstalled. Firefox Focus for me ! ü§îüí≠",

There's one bug I want to be fixed though, after I use it for a while it will stop letting me search things, when I try to search things all it will say is \"no suggestions\". It gets really annoying, the only way im able to get it to go back to normal is if I delete and re-download it.",
