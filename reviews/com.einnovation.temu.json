Since I play it a lot, I have noticed some issues lately, however. For example, I'm not sure if it's just my device, but I have been experiencing delays when I swipe, like it either takes longer than expected to move when I swipe or it just doesn't work. Other than that, I definitely recommend this game! Just hope the issue gets fixed soon.",

You can spend a lot of wasted time on the fishland game. Totally a waste of time. You'll never get the free items because it drops your rewards down so low. Its basically impossible. All in all the site has a lot of items to choose from. Some is junk but wow you can find excellent deals and awesome products. 👍🤗😁",

Up until the last 2 weeks or so, the app has been relatively ok with not throwing up the \"Spin to win\" or \"Enable notifications to get __\" too much. It's slowly gotten worse. Nowadays, after EVERY SINGLE THING I add to the cart, \"Enable notifications\" pops up. This is EXTREMELY annoying and it's pushed me to decide Shein is a better option to purchase a similar item. Uninstalling if this is not fixed.",

They listen in from your phone and more to sell an item that you talked about to someone else. I'm constantly seeing things I searched for or talked to someone else show up on Temu within minutes of me searching Google, etc. A complete scam! Very disappointed with it! Lots of bait and switch. Defective items purchased. Ended up throwing most away. Quality of clothes are substantial.",

      "text": "Great assortment and/or unique and practical items. Its like amazon and etsy blended. The shipping is free; frequently about a week. The items I've received were much better quality than amazon items at similar price points. The continual marketing notifications are very annoying. The flash promotions shown when you first open the app are practically impossible to actually win. Many items are made in small batches and sell out quickly but sometimes become available again later.",

However, every few minutes there's always a pop-up saying \"chance to win a free gift!\" But you have to actually buy something first or share a link with 5 different people before you can get anything. Another thing that's really irritating is the amount of notifications. I get notifications almost every few minutes from the app, even though most of the time it's absolutely nothing about a package that I got.",

Other than that the app is very good, the quality if the clothing items ain't the best but it is still very good and comfortable. But overall the rating will be 4/5.",

Instead of keeping the price-deduction consistent, it makes it harder and harder until it's not even worth it anymore. The shipping also messes up the packaging, and it looks like everything was just thrown together. My tattoos have come in all sorts of wrinkled and crushed. I don't think it's really worth it, and it's just a waste of time. It needs to let us buy our stuff after we share the code.",

Just like as store products. The returns can be complicated until you learn the app. The label process can also be confusing and complicated. But, mostly, it's a no issue process. Customer service is usually Great and helps to correct any issue.The Temu price reduction is awesome if you remember to use it, saves a lot of $ towards purches.",
