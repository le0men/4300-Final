The app isn't perfect but does much better giving an accurate translation. It would be nice to be able to save larger transcripts than currently able to now.",

It would be 5 stars if it could allow one to distinguish between formal and casual tense for Latin languages, and could account for certain dialects and idioms. I tried translating something and you changed the word for refrigerator three times. If I hadn't looked it up, I wouldn't have known that they were three different regional or dialectical words meaning the same thing. That is not helpful.",
