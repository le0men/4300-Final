Why?? I get a little to wordy when I'm writing but this app makes it more concise; since I am a Microsoft 365 customer, I also get help for writing errors as well as other items that the free option does not have for example, in Microsoft Edge and Word, so it's great",

My biggest complaint is it's difficult to find your previously generated images, you basically just need to save them or dig through MS designer. It would be nice if there was a gallery feature in the app where you can save the ones you like and easily find them again later. Or even pick up on those prompts later to further refine them.",
