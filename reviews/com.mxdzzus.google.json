Although the one thing that is bringing it down to a 3 star is that if you wanna change servers to play with a friend or leave a toxic world, you have to start all over. It's very sad and annoying. It would be a 5-atar if you could change servers and keep your progress.",

There is a shake animation, then you compare stats and decide to sell or equip. You get a lamp for each area you beat, and 4 for each boss area, among other ways. Your idle time that you are aware also generates lamps. So you are stuff just looking at a screen of equipment for like 75% of the game.

It also has a really toxic fan bas as seen in the discord and in game chat. But it does have a nice system but it does take forever for you to build up lamps and it seems it's gonna go under as another pay to win IDLE games. I would hate to see it make it to that demise. Otherwise though things, I would recommend the game for a game you play for 1-2 hours a day.👍",

However, it's hardly an idle game in that it requires a lot of button pressing, and even then, there isn't much choice in where there could be. Most of the interaction is through how the game asks you to spend money, practically begging with advertisements for a shiny weapon or gatchas. Disgraceful and disappointing.",

All the fun parts of playing are automated: spells, combat, exploring levels... But you get to pause all progression to check if piece-of-trash armor 1 is better than piece-of-trash armor 2. This is the only way to get stronger; xp and leveling are tied to selling gear, not combat or quests or, well, anything fun. I feel duped.",

My mobile is a Moto E5 with 16gb of RAM. It's not really bad. The game should be optimized for fix that. I really like the game and I want to play it without the crashes. Thanks.

First of all the application is extremely battery draining and heats up phone quickly even with lite mode on. The genie quests latter on past level 9(I think) are impossible to progress with unless you wait an extra day or pay money. Connection issues with game are also prevelant. Trying to log in without wifi is borderline impossible while logging in using the same amount of connection is possible in oh my dog.",
