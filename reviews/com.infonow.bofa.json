Example: if you have to pay a BofA credit card using your BofA checking account, you need to back out of a dead end \"pay\" button on your CC page, remember the last 4 digits of the account you want to pay, then remember the exact amount you have to pay. It isn't this difficult with other CC companies. Also, Erica is unnecessary garbage. Stop it.",

I uninstalled & reinstalled it. Update: The app doesn't crash as much as it used to. I don't recall that it has done that in a while. However, this is the only app that gives me a hard time with fingerprint recognition. I don't understand why. I use print recognition on several apps, this one sucks.",

Not transfer money, then ask if I want to pay BOA accounts or go to bill pay. I want to go directly to billpay like previous version of app.",

      "text": "At first it seemed a lil clunky meaning I didnt like the layout of certain options. After a while I realized I was just use to a different banking app and this one was fine. I.e. some options like external account transfers/wires etc are available in other mobile apps where as BOA has them exclusively on the website for security I guess. After some time I came to the conclusion that I shouldn't hold things like that against the BOA app, whose functionality otherwise is more than decent. So meh.",
