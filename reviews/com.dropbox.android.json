OMG it's so frustratingly slow, just to create a new folder takes forever, but mostly when using a Wi-Fi connection. So I'm constantly having to use my data. If I save a PDF file to Dropbox from an email it saves it as \"VIEW\" without the PDF extension at the end of the file name, so I'm forced to go back and rename that file every time. Google drive doesn't have these issues ever.",

It doesn't work the way the IOS version does. 1) it doesn't remember the last folder you saved a scanned doc, so you have to pick it again every time you go to save and 2) there isn't an option to save as a PNG format file. IOS doesn't have an option to save as JPG option. Why the inconsistency? Lazy propramming? Other apps like this don't have this problem.",

I've used it regularly (phone and PC) for years with my personal files as well as file sharing in a small business and had 0 issues. It looks, feels, and operates like a local folder. It's secured with PIN access. The features and services have expanded over the years staying in step with a growing market. The only deterrent may be the cost. IMHO Dropbox is the best and I recommend hands-on to help make that decision.",

My biggest complaint is that you can't lock your phone screen during playback, or the media stops playing. How annoying!!

I deleted my Dropbox account shortly after that, and for three months, I was still getting billed for a subscription that I did not have anymore. Reaching out to customer service was incredibly difficult, and when a man named Ron did finally email me back, he asked for a lot of credit card information that I was not comfortable giving out. I shortly after got an email that my subscription had been renewed and I had not given ANY CONSENT to activate or renew any subscription I once had.  I got curious and downloaded the Dropbox app to my phone, and when I tried to sign in, it showed no account with their service for my email address. I decided to go through my bank instead and placed a stop payment on any payments that they try to take out of my account in the future. I will be taking further action to receive a refund for the months that they billed me for unethically, and I do not recommend this service to anyone.",

      "text": "Very difficult!! I signed up for the free trial to see if this would be a good app to send large picture files to family. It has been the opposite of user friendly. Canceling the subscription is way too difficult for a regular person. It says it is sending you to options for cancelling that then don't exist. Just finding out what type of account one has is difficult. I use a lot of apps. I found this one to be frustrating with support fairly unavailable.",

      "replyText": "Hey there, sorry to hear about that. Cancelling a subscription must be done through the platform it was started on. That said, we suggest that you reach out to our teams on our Official Online Community https://www.dropboxforum.com/, or on social media on Twitter at @DropboxSupport, so we can take a look at this from our end. Thanks!",

If you try dropbox on your computer expect everything to be deleted. All my info and music was \"synced\" so basiclly it all disappeared. So 5 years of work is gone. And no way of getting it back, will be moving my whole family away from dropbox.",
