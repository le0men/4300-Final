I'd guess at least 80% of the time when you pick up an item and scan it it says item not available at this location. I'm literally holding it in my hand and scanning it. Also it's worthless to look up items to plan your trip. It will show that items arent in stock, but plenty of times I find it on the shelf. Also says things are in stock, but they aren't. Understandably there's loss and ppl having items in cart",

App navigation can be messy, but it's well compensated by the wide variety of items for purchase and tons of features (shopping lists, coupons/promotions, rewards program, etc) for happier shopping. Prices are reasonable but not usually lowest. Easy to choose between shipping and in-store or curbside pickup but may be confusing for those not used to online shopping.",

You can no longer use the website, arrange the order, then use the app when you get to the pickup. If you would prefer the larger web interface to better manage your pickup shopping, you are just out of luck. 2) Items listed as available on the app are NOT necessarily available in store -- even if the app says it is. Every order I've done has had 3-10 items that are NOT in the store. And you don't find that out until 4 hours later when they are done \"processing.\" If that item was important for pickup, you have to make other arrangements elsewhere. They do not notify you that an item is missing as they are \"processing\" it so that you can ask for alternatives. 3) If there's an error with the order, they don't tell you what has caused it. It's just a general error. You have to remove items until the order goes through. 4) There is no option for picking alternatives in case an item is out of stock. NONE. Again, you won't find out for 4 hours. You will not be contacted or notified if you would like a replacement. Unlike every other pickup at store app I use (instacart, kroger).",

Pages handle filters differently, so I never know if it's available for shipping, delivery, or in-stock locally. And there are unexplained delays when navigating around the app, this should be faster than shopping on the website. Checkout is the one streamlined bright spot. Just simplify the app.",

The worst is that, when you tell it to remember your device, it NEVER actually does (not on Android, at least), thus forcing you to get a security email passcode everytime you want to look at your Red card account. Worse still, every once in a while, the passcode email just will not send. It claims it does, but it never actually arrives.",

The great thing about Target is the ability to get all my groceries, produce and other items in one place, but the curb side pick-up limited options makes the Walmart drive-up a better option since you can add all those items. If Target wants to get in on the game of pick-up, make it equal to or better than all the competitors (Whole Foods, Walmart, Kroger, etc) otherwise it's a not really saving time since I still have to go inside, or somewhere else, for all my produce, frozen and refrigerated items.",
