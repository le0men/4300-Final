However, even though this is the simpler version of Roblox, there's a lot less to experience. Like how mobile players have a limited customization variation for the avatar editor, or less buttons to work with, bad screen crunch and not being able to edit and make games entirely. But if you are able to look past these issues, it's great.",

It sort of helps, and also when joining a game don't touch anything till everything is just about fully loaded in, it will still lag but it gives you a higher chance of playing.",

      "text": "Personally, I like the amount of games on Roblox and how everyone can make their own. But what really irritates me is the inconvenient placement of the jump button on mobile, specifically phone. Because it's small and tucked away in the bottom right corner, it's hard to tap on it the first time, which is especially annoying in parkour. And don't get me started with the auto rotate. It also makes it really hard to do parkour and throws off focus. I'd recommend adding settings to fix those issues.",

Another thing that can be annoying is you have to have really good wifi to play. And sometimes it will just randomly kick me off mid game.

For instance, in horror games you wouldn't want to type while you're running away from a monster. A negative affect is that a lot of underage children lie about their age and are annoying.",

Although there are some bugs in the game that would kick you out of the entire app. Like in Royale high, when you try to teleport somewhere, you just get kicked out. Also, in high-quality games, when you simply enter the game for like 2 seconds, it would just kick you out. Sometimes when your playing a survival game on a chromebook, you can't do certain controls because the system automatically thinks your on a mobile device. I find that extremely annoying.",

First: In mobile, the game crashes if I join a game. I hate this bug so much and after I re-open the game (Roblox) it won't open and say \"Please check your Internet connection\" even though my Internet is perfectly fine. Second: the jump button is either too small or not even there. But imo, It's an amazing game. ^^",

The jump button is the one and only problem. It's sometimes to small and i always click on the right and then I fall down after such a long way. Like I wish I could customize the jump button a little bigger it would make my life with obbies and towers and other people a lilttle better. I hope that gets added in future updates.",

In terms of gameplay, it's ok but sometimes if you exit the app, you end up with a camera malfunction where you can't move it at all or it simply crashes while joining certain games (the crashing part might be because my phone isn't the best but it is understandable). The buttons are also kind of small but with time you get used to it yet would love to get to customize them to my liking.",

I can play on touch screen but where the fun in that? just download it your phone or tablet. If you fix the problem about the mouse having problems moving the camera, i might give it a higher rating.",

Now for the optional features like showing the region in the server list so i'll get myself to a lower ping servers, and some additional button for anything like dropping items. The camera bug is fixable by just open the menu but, not all experience will fix it though, still fine to do it anyway",

I sometimes experienced a bug that makes my screen go black when I joined a game, I still can chat with my friends they said to rejoin and it works (I dont know if its just my device problem or game problem). So yeah, hope ya can fix that.",
