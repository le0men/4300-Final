As it stands now, it can't put a note anywhere but in the record of the conversation. I'll likely rollback until they get it sorted.",

For example, I wanted to know if I had a calendar event and it could not access my calendar. I wanted it to identify a song, but it couldn't do that, I wanted it to open the battery settings directly instead of having to ask it to open the settings and clicking on battery. Basic stuff that Assistant has.",

It really has no business replacing Google Assistant at this point, as it can't do basic things that assistant has done for over a decade. And if you disable assistant integration, it'll take it over the next time you open it. Absolutely mind-boggling that it was released like this.",
