The game itself is really cute with great graphics but it is ridiculous how much to pay to play a level and the game is set up to where you almost HAVE to buy coins to be able to play for a decent amount of time. It is ridiculous that I have it down to one or two tiles left to get rid of and 10 spare dominoes to change and none of them match and you lose the level. I really enjoy playing it but can't seem to play that much. Do not recommend",

It coats roughly 2000 gold to start a level, then you're only awarded 2300 if you're lucky for winning. Then you have to pay for extra moves. 2300 for one extra set of moves (3 tiles) that may end up not matching anything on the field. Sometimes my entire starting hand doesn't match anything on the field. But I already wasted 2000 coins to play the mission!",

Whoever thought of that concept sux. This game is cute and fun but it doesn't take long until the AI wins against you everytime and the levels start to cost more and more and you barely win what it costs. I've played for 3 days, can no longer play because I don't have enough coins to do so because the levels got so impossible.",

So far everyone that I have I have to try it, has enjoyed it and is telling all their friends and family about it as well.

I only won 3, a lot of time ending with one domino left. They obviously want you to use a booster. Three additional dominoes costs 54,000 coins,and there is no guarantee that you will get what you need. The gold domino, which is like a wild card, costs 65,000 coins. I'm not new to this game. I've been playing for around a year. I'm tired of the bullsh*t.",
