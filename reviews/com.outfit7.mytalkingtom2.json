The fly points wont go up past 102. And the mini/ bonas games wont load at all. It is upsetting because The worm/ snake game 8s the only thing i really like to do. And it wont load. I have uninstalled it and reinstalled it amd it wont work right. Please please fix this glitch?",

Also when you put Tom to sleep can you make the background turn dark like it's night-time? Sort of like when you put My Talking Angela (2) to sleep. Then you can also see the places you can visit including her house.",

So to recap: More clothes, accessories, decorations, get rid of the chances of getting duplicates, and fix the controls in Space Trail, and I'll rate higher.

The customization is also very limited and was one of my main let downs when compared to the first game, I would strongly advise not getting this game unless you enjoy watching ads to get any progress.",

I understand that, as that happens a lot anyways with ads. The one thing is that it kept redirecting me to google play, no matter if I pressed the back button or specifically went back in the app. If you have ads for your game, at least filter the junk out first.",

The items in the game including Tom's food, clothes and home decor, are expensive and the game doesn't offer enough coins to buy them...

Also leveling up takes a lot of time to do. I take care of my Tom pretty frequently, but it still takes a while to level up",
