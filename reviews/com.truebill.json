I signed up through a referral link from a creator to get a week free trial, and after the week is up I got charged the annual price of the \"monthly subscription\" that you chose to pay. Good thing I lowered it from $10 a month default to $4 because I would've been out $120 immediately which not everyone can afford. Would not recommend this app until they charge you monthly like expected. I feel lied to.",

Thanks to Rocket app credit report, I quickly saw that my oldest cc was no longer open and was able to quickly call them with number Rocket money provided and got my oldest account reactivated.",

A couple days later Rocket notified me of the charge!!! I canceled it myself but cannot get a refund. Pretty sure Rocket Money isn't going to pony up the 324 bucks I'm out. A thoroughly useless app and service.",

Please direct any requests for a refund to the service.\n\nPlease email DJ@rocketmoney.com if you need further help with our app.",

I tried adding a manual transaction, but it is nowhere to be found after I hit save. Everything else is great. I especially like the payday view to see what I have left, but, alas, it does not include the unwashed checks.",

However, the plaid services are not linking correctly with my American Express account. It seems to unlink everyday, and asks me to re-link every time. Also, it could not pull in my Amex checking and savings account, only my credit card. If this is corrected, I would give the app 5 stars and even pay for premium. Would probably work well for anyone who doesn't use Amex for banking.",

The app pays for itself because I easily save more per month thanks to the alerts on unused subscriptions, unusual transactions, etc. I especially love that the app will negotiate lower cell phone service bills as well as other household bills. I click a button and they do the work for me. What's not to love?",
