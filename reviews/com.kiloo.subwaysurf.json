You can roll, run, and duck as you climb the leader board, or just have fun with it! The seasons have changing themes from around the world too. 5 stars, would DEFINITELY recommend!!",

When I open Subway Surfers while music is playing, the music is paused. Resuming it results in ALL Subway Surfers Sounds being MUTED, even though they don't show as such.

It is a super smooth, lag-free game, which allows you to move faster and more complex, unlocking its full potential. Moreover, there are lots of events that used to be non-existent in the past. However, obtaining one of its new-styled characters without purchasing them with real-world money is almost impossible. That being said, money (or ads) is often required, but that doesn't make it less enjoyable.",
