But once I accidentally inputted $0 as my request refund (it was just $0 by default) and they accepted the dispute but I got no money out of it (and it was $40!). There's no way to dispute it again and no one to contact. That was just unlucky though, overall this app is good. Just be catios when disputing something, if you don't dot every i or cross every t, you'll loose your chance.",
