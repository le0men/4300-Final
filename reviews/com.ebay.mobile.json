This put me at 'below standard' so they take ~20% instead of the normal ~13%. Since it's a new year my next review (happens once a month) I'll be a top seller again. But in the 1 month since that I lost around $200 in Dec xmas revenue. Customer service is HORRIBLE. For the $ I pay in fees its ridiculous. I could go on",

      "text": "I've sold on eBay as individual for 20+years. We made eBay what it is. But since they've gone to small business model they've thrown individual sellers under the bus. I've been asked to pay 39% promo fee of $9.99 auction listing price for only 1 listing cycle, sell or not. & I just noticed on a search that if promo isn't purchased we get buried below \"to get all results click here\" so small most won't notice it. Today they changed shipping on sold auction to higher priced so I can't print label",

      "text": "Great for buying items never had issues there.. every item was received, account details never hacked, site is indeed secure. It's the selling I've found to be a bit more complex and by that I mean the payout process but then again it's not a source of income for me I'm just a casual seller. I honestly think the look of the site needs a makeover though..Very clunky, cluttered..not visually appealing compared to sites like amazon, etsy.. no offence but when did Ebay last updated their site/app?",

      "text": "Good resource for used and vintage goods, but could be better if made more friendly to multiple purchases from same seller that combine shipping expense. The current model is very much geared up for a single purchase and done, and some of the more recent changes with forcing an immediate payment on offers and such just reinforce that further, and make it extra cumbersome for buyers and sellers of multiple items in a single order. New/current items are very much hit or miss, in quality and value",
