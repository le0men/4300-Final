The worst possible time for it to flake out is when you're placing a big order and you're not sure if it went through and when you hit place order it shows you a screen that says page not found. Then you do it a couple more times and finally have to go to the web page on a PC to see how many times you placed the same order. Luckily this time only once, still it should not have happened. However I do LOVE Costco. Their customer support is absolutely top notch.",
