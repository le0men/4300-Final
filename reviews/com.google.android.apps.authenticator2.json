Switching to a new device requires that you set up Authenticator again for every account you use it with.  Switching, as long as your old device still works, is a giant pain in the posterior, and if your device is lost or broken, well, you are out of luck, and locked out of everything protected by this 2FA.  There is no way to backup or restore, or share account data between devices.  I realize that there are security implications for backup or sharing, but the usability issues of not having backup or share among devices basically make this application useless for real-world applications.  I switched to \"Authy\", which supports backup and sharing.  Maybe that is less secure, but if security locks out the authorized user, that's pretty unacceptable, too.  This should be rated as 2.5 stars.  It works, but the usability is very poor.",

Before this, I used Authy instead, because I wanted to be able to easily maintain a backup device or two with my auth tokens in case I were to lose my primary phone. Now, Google Authenticator has this functionality. And, unlike Authy, it works offline and doesn't transmit any data to a server. Auth token are one of the few things I would prefer not to have stored on a server in the cloud. Unfortunately, the most recent update also broke Wear OS compatibility. It's no longer possible to install the app on a Wear OS watch and if you still have the old watch app installed, it cannot sync with the new phone app. This is very disappointing. Authenticator codes on the watch were a huge benefit.",
