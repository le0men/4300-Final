I have to manually add them, except, I never receive the points for those items. Correcting the receipt doesnt actually do anything. I definitely miss the wheel. The games feature takes too long to earn points and installing apps is a hassle, for very little in return. I like being able to just snap a receipt, spon the wheel, get my points and get on with my day. Thx.",

When user selects a picture to view the promo item, it is helpful that user sees a slightly zoomed-in image but allow further zoom-in to see the words on the label.

It sucks that you have to wait 72 hrs to actually use your reward after redemption. And there needs to be a 'dark mode' option for the background. Other than that it's pretty good.",

Now, I can spend over $300 for various groceries and only get 25 points. Also, I'm not a fan of the \"download and play games for points\" stuff. I miss the wheel.

      "text": "I liked Fetch much better when you were able to spin for daily rewards. Now, to earn extra points, you need to go play games. I'm not into playing games on my phone, but I'm sure a lot of people are. Before, I just got to spin right after snapping the pic of my receipt. I use Kroger delivery and purchase almost all of my groceries this way. There is not a way to connect my receipts with my email the way I can with Walmart and Amazon purchases.",

      "replyText": "Daily Reward has since retired! While we understand games aren't for everyone, Fetch Play was only added to be an additional, totally optional way to get points on top of already snapping your receipts, which has not changed. If you have any other questions or feedback, let us know at support@fetch.com. Thanks!",

Still a few bugs to work out, like watching an ad for bonus items, I'm not returned to the game. If you contact Fetch, they do answer and try to help. I like this option over the daily spin where I rarely won anything beyond 25 points. Also, I do not have receipts to add every day, but I still can collect points. With a few tweeks, this could easily be 5 🌟.",
