A sheer genius might be able to keep playing, but that's a very tiny group, and they probably aren't wasting time playing games.",

Love the addition of items to be broken etc as you progress keeping it interesting and challenging but still achievable.

Also some of the full screen ads after completing levels are getting very inappropriate. The ads are allowed by app not google store. Poor taste on an app for \"everyone\".",

Anyway, at level 94, the ads started interrupting *While* playing. Not when i needed to revive or use a life, randomly in game. 😡 I also feel i shouldn't have to watch an ad just to play or to use my lives while in game. This game is more like \"watch ads to try a puzzle!\" It gets worse the more you play. & Reward system is poorly desifned too.",

Tiles are cleared and counted when a stack's at least 10 tiles high. Main complaint is that the way the stacks flip SEEMS to be random, which makes strategy kind of impossible. There are no instructions in the app. Would be a solid 4-star game if there was a clear way to predict stack flip in order to plan ahead.",

Every few levels, you're forced to watch an ad, unless you pay to remove these ads. Optional ads are one thing. Forced ad breaks are a deal breaker. Do better, and lose the greed.",

If you controlled which direction stacks flipped and maybe also when full stacks disappeared (since you can overload them), you might be able to not lose so long as you had sufficient skill. But then you wouldn't watch ads for extra blank spaces, revive, clear stack, etc. So the game controls everything but where you put the new stacks it dealt you and plays dumber the longer it's been since you watched an ad.",

There are boards you can not win without using the power ups and I'm pretty sure if you buy the ad free you will still have to watch to get extra board spaces and power ups which is false advertising cause ad free means AD FREE.
