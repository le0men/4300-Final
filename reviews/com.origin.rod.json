Personally, I would like to see a mode where you have to manually control your units to choose their attacks, for example hard difficulty raids. The free draws are actually in the game, although not to the extent you may want. You get x10 summons free per day, which is better than any other game I've seen offering those \"10,000 draws\" which is a lie.",

My only complain would be that it lacks VA's, I don't know why, but the only monster that seems to have Voice Lines is the Slime, which is kinda weird, why would you just give voice to one single character that isn't even that... Fantastic(?), special(?). I know it doesn't affect the gameplay but it would be nice for other characters to have Voice Lines. But so far it's good.",
