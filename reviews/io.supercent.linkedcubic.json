If U run into the magnet it's supposed to automatically scoop up anything within a certain radius of U but since a about a week ago it doesn't even work and actually now glitches to where U can't pick ANYTHING up with the magnet.

I would've rated it 5 stars , but i have to rate a 3 cos 1: every time you finish a game , an add comes up and 2: when i press close on the add on the bottom of the screen, it says we've got rid of it but IT KEEPS COMING UP OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I like the game,Supercent, but PLS get rid of constant adds!! Thnks.",

The \"power-ups\" in game, mainly the magnet, are so few and far between, it becomes virtually impossible to progress in the game as you're never able to achieve enough to beat the end of level boss. Even if you watch ads to gain each power up before starting the level, it's next to impossible to beat the level. First couple of levels are doable. Now it's just a waste of time.",
