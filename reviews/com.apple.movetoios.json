      "text": "What an awful, awful app. As much as Apple may hate Android, you would think they might put a modicum of effort into an app that is meant to switch people to their own platform. And yet, here we are. Seriously, this must've been made by the bottom of the barrel of their software team. There was no thought (limited thought at the most) put into the data transfer process. Why in the hell can data only be transferred over Wi-Fi? Was the reasoning supposed to be security? Because nothing is more secure than a direct cable connection, and it also happens to be faster. Perhaps their thought was that a user might accidentally yank out the cable in the middle of the transfer and have to start the process over again - which might be fine IF their Wi-Fi transferring worked. As you might be able to tell from the plethora of other reviews, it almost never works. When you do manage to connect, the estimated time is absurdly long, and often drops connection or runs into an error during the middle of the transfer. It's awful, and I hate that this is the only free way to transfer text messages from an Android phone. But seriously, it's 2022. Almost every Android phone from the past 5 years has been using USB-C, and the cable you get in the box for new iPhones is USB-C to Lightning. You'd think that a data transfer using the cable included in the box (that conveniently has both connections most people would need) would be a no-brainer. But I guess it's a tiny-amount-of-brainer, because the no-brains who design and update this app still manage to miss the mark. Hope they fix the Wi-Fi issues and add a cable transfer method, because this is an awful way to introduce people to the iPhone ecosystem, and I imagine it'll drive away many people who can't figure out alternate ways to transfer data.",

      "text": "This app is terrible. The support and instructions for this is just as bad. I tried for two full days to transfer my messages. This is the only way to do it. Apple Support sent me to a local shop, blaming my WiFi. The tech at the shop told me they have never been successful in this app working its way to completion. At that point, I had to decide if I wanted to switch to iOS and lose my message history or stay on Android.  It doesn't make sense about the WiFi comment from Apple because the iOS is the one broadcasting and is the backbone for transferring them. If you don't need to migrate your messages, there are other apps to transfer contacts, photos, and other items. Use those instead. So you might want to try to migrate your messages only and then use the other apps to transfer photos, etc.  If you are making the switch, here are some tips: * Don't activate your iPhone until this completes. Otherwise, you'll get texts, phone calls, etc. even though you're iOS device hasn't been fully set-up. If you do view your call log or texts, you'll have to go through the setup and then do a device factory reset and start the Move to iOS process all over again.     * It uses a private WiFi SSID from the iOS device to the Android device. For no more than 5 seconds, the Android device needs to connect to the SSID. If it doesn't, it just continues and tries to use your WiFi but it never goes anywhere and there is no indication from either app that nothing is happening.     * If you don't see a pop-up on your Android device that you connected to the SSID \"iOS xxxx\", then you might want to take a 3rd device out and then look to see if the iOS device is broadcasting it or not. There were multiple times I didn't see it broadcast so I knew to start over again.     * If you have to start over, it is best to restart both devices.     * Make sure that you leave both devices alone until the transfer finishes. For example, on your Android device, the Move to iOS app should stay on-screen the whole time. If you use another app or get a phone call on your Android before the transfer finishes, your content won't transfer. So maybe take the SIM card out and silence all notifications on your Android device.      * The instructions say, \"should stay onscreen the whole time\". Does this mean that if you turn off the screen, everything stops? What about burn-in? Even so I would advise to just leave it on because anecdotally, it seemed to go further (until it didn't). It is crazy that Apple engineers have to have the Android app in the foreground at all times with the screen on to make this work. This seems like a relic from pre-2000.      * Even though this doesn't work the first time, there is no mention of what happens if you want to only transfer messages only. My guess is that you then have to use other apps to transfer Photos, Music, Device contacts, etc. What progress indicators they have either constantly spins or there is a line that never fills up. At times, it may tell you how much longer it will take to complete, but if you triple that time and return to your device, it is still stuck on the same message. Perhaps they should have a progress indicator of how many kilobytes out of how many gigabytes are moving across the connection. Yes, kilobytes because it feels like waiting for a file transfer over a 14k modem.  Once you do get the file transfer, there are no warnings like \"the app stopped working due to.... \"   Good luck - hope you have better luck than me. I understand that Apple touts the security of iMessage but I would think that they would try to make this one of their most robust applications, not their worst.",

Every subsequent attempt, seven resets of the iPhone, plus reinstallations of [Don't] Move to iOS, failed. Seemed to me the app hangs if it sees an iPhone has previously been activated on the account. AT&T's generally excellent AT&T Mobile Transfer app unfortunately isn't a full answer because for Android to iOS it doesn't transfer SMS messages, text or photo. In the end the only thing that saved me is that successful first attempt had backed up on iCloud (definitely an Apple plus there), or I'd have been faced with a choice between losing nine years of messages or staying with Android. That's no choice at all; I'd have gotten a refund and stayed with Android. Apple -- FIX THIS! When it works, it's great. But 95 percent of the time it seems it does not work.

I recommend people skip the photo transfer and do that after the fact with google drive; otherwise you aren't going to be able to use your phone(s) for about 6 hours. You will also need to stay near the iphone as you can't adjust the screen timeout until you are post setup, and it will time out about every 30 seconds",

After a trip to the apple store and a call with Lvl 2 support the response from Apple was 'try it again and hope it works, best we can suggest'. It moved all the pictures, but forgot to move the dates on some of them -- so pictures from a few years ago show up as taken today. Went with a 3rd party app instead and had to pay out the nose for it to work",

      "text": "This app DOES work but you have to do it in a very particular way, and it will not tell you if you're doing something wrong until the very end. I tried and failed several times to transfer JUST my messages. Each time took about 2 hours and it ultimately just gave me an error message. But like I said, there IS a way to make it work. Here's the key: The Android app HAS to connect to an artificial Wi-Fi network broadcast by the iPhone. The problem is 9/10 times, the app won't tell you to do that. You need to make your Android phone forget ALL your local Wi-Fi networks before beginning the process. Just putting it on airplane mode won't work. You should also disable your mobile internet connection. Honestly I just took the SIM out just to be safe. ONLY if your Android connects to the iPhone's fake Wi-Fi network will this process work. I learned this from a post on Apple's website by another frustrated user. You can search for \"Move To iOS app transfer error solutions\" to find the post on Apple's website -- it was quite helpful, so thank you to that user. Pretty ridiculous that that clearest instructions for using this app came from a user and not Apple itself.",

I'm moving to iPhone for a while because I'm tired of buying Android phones full of bloatware that are only supported for a year or two. With all the negative reviews of this app I was expecting the worst. But it worked great transferring everything except pictures on the SD card (backed-up to Google account) from my Bold N1 with Android 10 (talk about off-brand!) to a new iPhone 11. I turned on wireless (5G) and Bluetooth (not sure if this was necessary). It took about 30 minutes and everything looked good on the new phone. So, again, scratching my head over why so many people with \"mainstream\" Android phones had so many problems.",

I had about 60 or so albums and the app transferred them all into the \"Recents\" section of the photos app. Transferring the photos via iTunes will copy them to your new phone and they remain in their respective albums. My albums were on my SD card and I copied them all over into a master photos folder on my PC, and then listed the same master photo as the location for syncing via iTunes. It took about 30 minutes to copy the photos over. I also have a cloud backup of my photos, but like having copies on my phone in case of a poor internet connection.",
