I don't know what else I could have for FREE that could have done the same. All I do is transfer money to the credit account, use just like a credit or debit card (no APR, btw), which you use like a declining balance. At the end of the month, it pays that amount as a payment then reports to credit as paid in full.",

Luckily the amount was only a couple 100 dollars and not a couple 1,000. Still my money is my money and I want to be able to depend on my card company to help me when the merchant sends me an email telling me I'm entitled to a refund and I should dispute the claim. Photos to support your claim are all you can submit. The whole process feels like it's run out of a garage. I'm done",

For the love of all that is holy, if you need your money, DO NOT EVER use the \"Check cashing via photo\" feature. it takes forever to get YOUR money. I used it Friday Mar. 1 at 7:01 AM PST, and here it is, Mar. 7, 4:40 PM PST, and the app says my funds will be available \"end of the day\". Just gotta starve for another 8 hours. #Hungry",
