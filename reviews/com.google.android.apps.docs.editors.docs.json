Now I have to use ReadEra to read all other types of files. Maybe I'm wrong, but I've come to expect Google to give the best package in whatever genre it touches. Best meaning free, quick and fully comprehensive.",

So I deleted it again, not wanting it there. The bug is that the deleted collaborated doc keeps reapearing in my main docs. It is not a major problem, but I would like it to be fixed.",
