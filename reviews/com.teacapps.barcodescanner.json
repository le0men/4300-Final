Ads: There is a small ad strip at the bottom of the screen less than finger's width. Not intrusive or confusing at all. Small popup asks you to rate the app. Press \"later\" use the app, then rate it at some point. easy. Results: Options to use Google, Amazon, etc. for results. Info results are as good as what is available on the web. Access to your camera and the ability to retrieve results from the web are the ONLY permissions that have been requested by the app. Confusion: MANY of the negative reviews here are based on a different developer's app. This is an excellent app. If I used this kind of utility more often, I'd buy the pro version without hesitation.",

Features like continuously scanning or vise-versa, turning on confirmation of scan when different bar codes come into view are a god-send. Being able to share different barcodes as contacts or wifi details are amazing as well. Scanning is super fast and consistently reliable. Purchasing the PRO version is well worth the cost. The only con I've come across (and not a whole lot of barcode scanners have this) is there is no ability to POST the barcode to an arbitrary url for automation purposes. It certainly lets you execute a GET call with the contents of the barcode as a parameter in the URL, but some barcodes (esp. QR codes) can have data not befitting a url parameter. Adding the option to send this data as the body of a POST call would be enough to avoid switching to another app.",

This app allowed me to open the photo as a file and save it as a new, unblurred QR code, which I was then able to scan and import! Not quite sure how the app pulled this off, but it did and I am very grateful! Thanks all :)",
