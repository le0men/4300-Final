Using their services online put my account in limbo. Had to call to get it unstuck. Wifi is fine once it's set up but changing literally anything is a disaster. 2. One of my computers got \"paused\" even though I didnt do anything and my app doesnt have necessary features to fix the issue so I can't connect to the internet. Switching Soon.",

My internet is down and can't even get into the app to see what's wrong after resetting my router. Force stopping the app and restarting it doesn't help. Every update to this app just makes it worse. At least I was able to use the app in previous versions. I can't even get to the main menu. I'm on a pixel 6 pro with current android version.",
