I thought the package may have gotten lost because it said it was on transit, but then the same thing happened in January, and I still haven't gotten that package either. Im not able to get a refund because it's been so long. I want my 30$ back.",

When placing a large order, I'm now missing out on a €50 discount that I would normally get. Also, on item pages, it now shows \"estimated price\", which is lower than the actual price when I go to check out, so it's also misleading. Because of this it is no longer cheaper than other sites, so I won't be ordering as often anymore.",

I remember when Shein coupons were not maxed & you'd actually receive the amount off depending on the %, but now they're all capped. (No incentive to order big) Since they've gotten the Marketplace they superimpose coupons so now you barely get anything off your order. No free shipping for small placed orders. Everything sells out extremely fast. I order less & less from them now and will start using Temu & AliExpress 💯👌🏽",

Most of products are not returnable anymore and if by any mistake you choose them, after two/three weeks of waiting you will receive a useless product that you cannot do anything with it! After three years of being a consistent customer of Shein I decided to stop ordering from Shein only because of very inconvenient return process.",

They take an order and turn it into several small orders so when a shipment comes if there are things missing you can only claim things that are in one sml order together. They won't even have anyone reach out to try and fix it after closing all other claims because they are from the same shipment. Missing 18 of 30 things and they were Xmas gifts. I'm closing my membership and deleting. I hope I can stop someone else from getting scammed!!",
