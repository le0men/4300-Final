They charge $40 to file state taxes and then somehow added the deluxe service for $50 which I couldnt opt out of. Throughout the process they ask if you want to add a couple different services and both times I said no. But somehow a $50 service was automatically added. Then it would be another $45 if you want the payment taken out of your refund. This is the last year I use Turbotax! What a scam.",
