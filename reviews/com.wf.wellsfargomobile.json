Also, the app doesn't really show my deposits on it, and it's starting to frustrate me—I'd like something other than texts.",

If you do once you back out you're back at the top of the list. Then you've got to start the painful scrolling all over again. The UI is now so messed up and terrible to use that it's almost impossible to find anything anymore, besides. The old app version worked wonderfully. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.",

Once I'm on the transaction history I can't even scroll thru it! It keeps jumping back up to the top. It's truly unusable. Another bizarre thing happens after I've opened the WF app and then switched to another app, about 5 minutes later the Wells Fargo app pops back up in front of the other app, interrupting whatever I'm doing.

If you change your phone's minimum width (dpi) in your phone's developer settings, the app goes from having a normal app-like UI to literally just displaying the website (as if you were on computer). For this reason, I've been unable to use fingerprint sign on for about 3 years, and the UI isn't good since it's displaying a website on a phone screen.
