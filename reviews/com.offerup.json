Because of algorithm, not everything pops up & often the same unwanted merchandise repeats. Old stale ads only displayed nearest you. Click on an item and that item becomes your primary algorithm",

This app is just like craigslist was just as it started to go down hill. Update. Don't bother selling. You'll get almost no views. This app isn't the same at all and is officially useless. I think they want you to pay to bump your listing and when you don't you get no views. Ppl now listening their items for 0 JUST to get views.",
