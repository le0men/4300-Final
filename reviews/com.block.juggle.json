I've literally played this game all night and there is two awesome versions. the adventure and the regular game and both are super fun and challenging as you keep playing. Plus a bonus game when you go to settings and hit more games that's also super cool and Tetris like. And there is no ads except when you run out of space and want to revive. Then you watch a short ad. I cannot recommend this game enough!!!",

Oddly enough ( my fault or whatever) I was playing a game called Color Blast:Block Puzzle Game (exactly the spelling) which constantly crashed, but same type of game play. I deleted it to reinstall through Google games, and it wasn't there. Instead this one was there that looked the same except for the spelling. Odd right? So far this one works good.

Full screen 30secs+ ads automatically show up in the middle of making critical moves, causing the game to hang/pause for milliseconds in other to redirect you to the ad... When you're back, best believe you'd make a wrong move/shake. It doesn't also blur out tiles that have no possible position to fix them in the board. NOT RECOMMENDED.",

The proof is that at the beginning of the game, the logarithm actually gives you the blocks you need no matter how clumsy you are, only to turn on you after a minute or two, just long enough to make you endure yet another ad.",

You had the chance to decide between adventure (where you had a given puzzle to fix) or classic (where it was a complete clean slate) and now it's both puzzles which kinda ruined it for me cause I liked classic. It was fun to play. Now it's just... Why have two different options but have to same outcome lol. Idk why they changed it. But 2 stars for the memories cause I'm uninstalling",
