I like the fact that one can go in and get your lumber cut to the specific length you need for free for first 5 cuts or so and then it is only a $1 per cut aftet that. I find extremely handy when one has limited space in a vehicle. They have have a huge selection of plants all year round as well.

My 1st attempt couldn't understand my issue and left me on hold, but EDUARDO was GREAT, even @ 1:30am, very pleasant and PATIENT. He is a GREAT customer service rep!
