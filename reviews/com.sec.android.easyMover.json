Be aware, however, that the Samsung apps for the S6 are not the same as the apps on the Tab A. Clock, Calendar, and Contacts have a different look and feel about them. I much, very much, prefer the Tab A apps. I suspect the S6 apps were originally designed for phones while the Tab A apps are more suited for tablets.",

I just run Smart Switch periodically, and that takes care of it. At first, my Chrome bookmarks were in the folders on my target device's home screen, but they were grayed out and wouldn't work when pressed. But after giving it some time, they eventually got backed up and worked again. I'm not sure how long that takes - it was a couple of days before I checked them again, but anyway, now they're working.

That wasn't the issue of the app though, that was something I didn't realize I was doing. It was a time consuming process, but using the app was very seamless and I was suprised with how smooth my transition was between devices. I will never manually transfer the data over ever again!",

      "text": "This app is absolute garbage. It's time estimates are off by orders of magnitude. IT LITERALLY DRAINS ONE OF THE PHONES CONNECTED TO IT WITHOUT WARNING and there's no way to turn it off. Have 2 phones charged to 80%? don't worry, one of the phones with inefficiently sap power from the other until one dies before the transfer is done. And the only way to figure out it's happening is a tiny little sliver of a notification that once clicked makes you scroll ALL THE WAY to the bottom of the pop-up menu only to find out that you can switch the direction of the battery drain, but can't turn it off all together!!! I honestly want to know who shoehorned this stupid ripoff of a much better google pixel feature (you can turn it off completely) into this app and who approved it. Because it literally kills the ability to transfer data from an old phone to a new phone without a wireless charging puck.",

The process seemed to go just fine, and there were no errors. However, I discovered later that several apps and settings did not transfer to my new phone, which caused me to spend a lot of time figuring out what happened. For instance, I use and previously paid for multi instances of the Time Recording Pro (TRP) app. After the SS transfer, the TRP app no longer recognized my payment. After writing the TRP developer, I learned that Smart Switch did not transfer the required DynamicG utility plugin app that monitors the multi instance license, and I had to manually install it from the Play Store.",

DO NOT DISCONNECT. I've tried restoring by following its direction 3 times and every time majority of my apps were not installed(even though it said it did). On my last try before giving up I DID NOT disconnect my external SSD even when it prompted me that it's OK to disconnect. It took significantly longer to restore and finish this time but every app has been restored. 3 stars for wasting my time with incorrect direction but it eventually worked.",

Specifically, ECG data from Health app. It did NOT warn me I would have to re-setup all of my accounts. If transferring account credentials is not possible for security reasons, fine, but at least this app could guide the user through re-entering those credentials all at one time, during the setup process.
