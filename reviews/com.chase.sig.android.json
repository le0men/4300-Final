I can't type in my full, secure account-password each time, so I just unlock by fingerprint. That is not secure.",

Of course, a lot of branches have been closed, because \"mobile banking is so convenient.\" What's the deal Chase, is it suddenly 1997 again?",

The app does NOT notify me when a merchant cancels a transaction or provides a refund. But the app gives me TWO notifications for every charge that's pending. The app only notifies me of charges over $1--not over $0. Why? The app does NOT notify me when a charge has been modified like when I add a gratuity at a restaurant. One would think this is a critical component of any security notification system. This makes the notification system worthless because it's not an accurate representation of my statement.  Logging in as another user breaks the already-broken notifications so that I have to log in to my account again and disable and enable all of the notifications to get them even half-working again. The app must be able to handle two users (e.g., a couple with their own Chase credit cards). Also, Chase's two-factor authentication system still uses the hacked SMS system instead of one-time passwords. This has become so tedious and time-consuming that I'm considering canceling my credit card and moving to a new bank.",

Viewing a transaction list under See All Transactions for an account, the thick blue lines should be shifted. They appear to separate the transactions by date and activity, but this is not the case. Each date belongs to the next transaction BELOW the line rather than the same transaction between the blue lines. This is not very intuitive and should be fixed to eliminate confusion.",
