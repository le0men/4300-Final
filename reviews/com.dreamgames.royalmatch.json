AND when you pay, all of the sudden you win level after level then BOOM, 900 coins for the last 5 moves....and you do that...the suddenly the coins you bought are gone after a few levels. I have to give it to the games developers. It's highly addictive and you will spend serious $$$.",

I'd suggest offering customization options with decorating at the absolute least.

      "text": "A lot of fun for a while and totally ad free which is great. Unfortunately, once you reach later levels, it becomes near impossible without power-ups and once your free power-ups are finished, you're almost forced to spend money or wait for ages just to clear one level. Also a lot of false advertising on it as the ONLY ads I've ever seen for the game are the Kings Nightmares, which are probably max 5% of the levels. The rest are typical match 3 levels and can get repetitive quickly.",

      "text": "So this game is fun to pass the time, but it is also completely rigged to make you spend money. The number of times levels end with just one more thing to complete is insane. Also, if you watch closely when lots of stuff is going on, there are combinations that are made to give you power ups that the game ignores. The AI running in this game is clearly designed to get you just close enough to finishing so you feel like you have to pay to continue.",

And when you clear a level you get the same amount of rewards. It should be more as you get higher. It just gets you annoyed after a while that you are getting higher and higher but you still get the same amount of rewards. Update. Here I am still playing hoping to see better rewards for getting higher and spending so much money! And.... nothing. You still get the same",

Everything I've been seeing so far is just arranging rooms through sliding of objects and it is so annoying. Like! why the heck will you not do what the ads says?",
