They also tried to send me a xumo box saying it was free the forst month and charged me $165 and I had not even activated it. I returned it without activating. Because I found out they raised the prices I tried to downgrade but it is not an option unless ypure in a life chat with an agent for them to do it for you. The app never works.

I have failed 2 final exams and had to appeal to the University of Memphis School Board to let me retake them on campus because Spectrum internet will go out for a couple seconds for no reason and then start back up a few second later. This happens everyday. also, when I reported issues, they were good at sending a technician to help but it took 5 times for me to get a \"level 3\" technician to come help. I wish I could say more.",
