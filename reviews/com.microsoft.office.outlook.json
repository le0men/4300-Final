But DND doesn't work! I have tried all ways and all how! And every Saturday and Sunday my email notification starts @828 and waking me up for no reason! This is the most annoying app ever and gives me anxiety! I hate the notification sound when I'm NOT being paid to work! Turning off notifications in the phone app settings works.",

Devs seriously need to fix the issue with the Up Next complication not working as it always only shows the first meeting of the day even when it has passed. Also, neither Google calendar or Outlook offer sync capabilities for the other calendars, so with personal Gmail calendar and work on outlook, I'm left with a half functioning very expensive analog watch.",

I have repeatedly sent emails by mistake too early by accidentally pressing the Send instead of Dictate. Please could you move the Send button so that it is nowhere near any of the buttons needed for composing the email. Ie there's nothing in the top right of the screen. Surely this has been spotted in development and testing, seems a little obvious!",
