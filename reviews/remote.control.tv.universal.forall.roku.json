Only downside is, the ads that pop up look like part of the app. Update: non skip-able ads on a remote control app is unbearable. Especially when a commercial comes on tv and its 27 decibels louder than the show you were watching but you have to sit through a 30second ad( sometimes 2) before it lets you actually use the remote. Sorry, I had to lower my rating and uninstal.",
