Finally,  I realized I needed to install this app and hoped it would work when (and if) the phone came back online. I desperately kept refreshing my browser looking for an update, then BAM! The phone popped up on the map a few blocks away. I wasn't expecting that. the phone wasn't moving so I hoped that meant someone turned it in somewhere. I raced to that corner and started asking around. Sure enough someone turned it in at one of the stores I had been in. Turns out I didn't lose it in the subway after all but accidentally dropped in the ice cream freezer. What a relief!",

One of the biggest points of this app is being able to remotely ring a device if you cannot find it (eg it fell in a couch cushion, left on a shelf, whatever). But at some point in the last 6 months or so, it stopped working reliably. I finally figured out why. If your device is in DO NOT DISTURB, and \"alarms\" are blocked, this will not work - at all. This is completely stupid. This app requires device admin permissions, and it somehow cannot bypass do not disturb? This makes absolutely no sense, and it completely nullifies any usability of this when its needed most. Phone in do not disturb? Can't call it to locate it. That was ALWAYS the point of this app for me. And now that doesn't work AT ALL, unless you specifically allow alarms as an exception. There are times when you literally want EVERYTHING turned off, but you want this ONE thing to actually work, and now it doesn't do that any more. Maybe its not the apps fault. Maybe its because of stupid changes google made in Android 10. Either way, its broken, its useless, and I'm probably going to be done using pixel devices as a result.",

Well, I also kept my faith and trust in the locking feature and the wiping feature. But today tested the sound feature to find the device, and no sound is coming from either of the devices I'm checking out today (June 11, 2021 Friday). Get this fixed, and make it available on EVERY android device, even the pseudo-flavored android devices.

This app is wonderful in theory, but it lacks one thing in execution: what if the phone this app is on is the only phone you personally have? That makes the app useless. It would be great if there was a similar app for your laptop (if you don't have a tablet) to remote lock your lost phone. That would be immensely helpful, and Google should have thought of that and made it readily available. But I shall see if such an app exists, because I want an app like that for my laptop to remotely lock my phone in the event I lose it. i live on 70 acres of land. While I don't lose my phone easily, I still live on 70 acres of land, so losing it is likely.... and I can just go, boop, note it missing on my laptop, track it on my laptop, and not interrupt the work of my family members. 4 stars.",
