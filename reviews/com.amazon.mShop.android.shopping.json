Now lately it gets stuck where I have to scroll up to give a shove to scroll down to get it to respond and move the page. I have tried repeatedly tapping on a product I want to select and nothing happens but I can still scroll so it's not completely frozen. Being that I'm not the only one apparently, I'm inclined to think it's not my phone. Pls fix!",

They have everything from groceries to medication and If you pay for their prime membership you'll get access to perks and free shipping on most orders. You're able to track the location of your orders right in the app and most items are delivered within a few days. I've had a couple of experiences with lost packages and Amazon sent out the replacement without delay. I saved almost 1000 with Amazon in 2023!",

They let you fill your cart but during checkout there are many options. The shipping and availability changes consistent with availability. As well I find that the app does create ads on my mobile in other apps as well as social media. Subscribe and save might cancel every scheduled delivery but I still saves $$",

Some friends of mine have been Amazon employees and all have only had negative things to say while working there. Seems like everything I buy off Amazon these days is defective from the box. Pretty weak selection of Prime video content as well. I'm tired of it all and I rarely use Amazon anymore.",
