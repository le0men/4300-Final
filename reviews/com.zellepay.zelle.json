Support is slow, and the options for changing your info is incredibly limited. If you have a new email address, you need a password to change it in the app. If you forgot your password (write it down!!!), they require the cvv of the card on file to reset it. If your card has changed since, and you do not have the cvv of the old card on file, then you must call support. Support is not responsive in a quick manner, and any transactions you may have been sent to your new email will be lost. As a struggling student, this is the most frustrating experience I've had with a money-sharing app. I would not say this is a reliable way to exchange transactions.",

They claim you can connect with a debit card, but any attempt at that just gives errors, and eventually locks your account entirely. I contacted their support and they claimed nothing was wrong and told me to try again. And, no surprise, it still didn't work. Go with something reliable like Venmo, this app is complete garbage.",

      "text": "The service itself is fine.  The problem is with the application itself.  I registered on Zelle with my spam email address because I only use my preferred email address with business contacts.  Well, the sender sent the payment to my preferred email address so I was unable to receive it.  I tried adding my preferred email address as a secondary email account but the application kept giving me an error \"Unable to register email\".  It turns out that this is a problem with the app and the solution is to have the sender cancel the payment and resend it to the registered email account.  This should be a simple problem to fix.  It certainly makes one wonder if they have this problem, what other more serious problems lurk under the hood.",

Yet, I have to try and process the payment probably 5+ times before it actually goes through. Always gives me an error and says contact my bank. EVENTUALLY, the payment will go through if I keep trying over and over again. This app truly sucks and they don't ever seem to release an update to fix the issue.",

I changed my profile back to the account to which I have received transfers via Zelle in the past. yet the transactions still says failed and no one at my bank, my client's bank or Zelle seems to be able to \"see\" the transaction to get it out of limbo. What good is technology if the people who promote it don't have access to it when there is a problem. Stick with Cash App, you have more control over your money even when it leaves your bank account.",
