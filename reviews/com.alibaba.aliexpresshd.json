The app should be streamlined in a better way. One thing I hated the most is the ad or notification that pop up when you open the app. Over all, would you use it again and continue purchasing from Ali Express.",

They used to be really great, but now when you order something and the seller sends the wrong items ( it doesn't matter if it $2 or $80) they won't provide a refund as long as you get something. I ordered a replacement screen that cost me $80 and the seller sent me one from a totally different product, even though the listing clearly said it was for the unit I had. Even with pictures showing it was totally the wrong size, AliExpress refused to do anything. Stay Away!!",

The moment I decided to return an item that cost a whopping $3 the company decided to treat me like a circus animal and make me jump through so many hoops just to get a simple return going. I paid for the shipping to get the item. Now I have to pay the shipping to return the item because of a mistake on the seller's end. Yeah, that's not happening.
