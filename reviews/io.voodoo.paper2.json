Often when there would be an add, it would freeze and go dark. The only way it would unfreeze was when I swiped out of the app, that made me lose all my progress on the map I was just on. It also wouldn't give me the percent that I had gotten before it froze. Its not too big of a deal, but that was why it couldn't be a five star.",

Sadly a lot of things require you to watch a video - boosts, extra lives, etc. You can't actually get any of them. I paid $5 for no-ads, and I STILL have issues - don't buy it.",

      "text": "Amazing game, absolutely love playing. The adverts can be frustrating sometimes with the constant breaks in between playing,though. However,that isn't the main issue, I've noticed when you are over 60% coverage of the map,the next advert that will play will crash,forcing you to restart the app. It also happens when you want to revive yourself with over 60% coverage the advert will play,but then the app will appear to freeze and not let you tap anything. I'd love to keep playing if this is fixed.",

The only two problems are is that there are too many ads! Second of all, since there's breaks, you have to watch a thirty second ad every six minutes! Needs a tiny bit more improving, but still good.

I understand that an ad is used to run the game financially but like there is an ad every 30-45 seconds. You die, you get an ad. You are in the battleground and suddenly it is breaktime - you get a chance to get a powerup. Watch a video the get the powerup, say no thanks, still watch an ad. It's starting to be so repetitive and annoying.",

They game is hardly playable because of this as the game starts immediately after the add so often, people kill you. Also, after you get to 100%, the game crashes and doesn't load your points. I also got attacked in my world, and it didn't tell me how they attacked or how I can attack them back, so that's irritating. Great idea, though.",
