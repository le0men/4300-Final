To date I have not received a bill, but I did get a late notice. I paid immediately, and app says I will get a confirmation email. how about that! but to date no bill or invoice of any kind to remind me. I guess its an easy way to cause a customer some trouble. PS, the dollar would have been paid initially, but the agent seemed to forget what we had discussed",

Had progressive run into an issue processing my card via auto pay, my card was fine, their system had the error. Only warning they gave was was right before canceling my service, which i got late so my insurance got cancelled. After paying extra fees for reinstatement for their mistake, I'm also noticing my rate has doubled. Stay away.",
