Therefore, you cannot budget or monitor the accounts very well. So annoying! The objective of this APP is clearly different than MINT. In my opinion, MINT is better!",

It only allows you to connect one property with a loan, to keep track of your net value on it, and sets your property values ridic high (can't override) & vehicle values are much lower than in mint.",

For example, if I'm putting in the wrong email, don't give an error message stating: \"We can't contact Credit Karma at this time.\" This implies it's down for maintenance or something. Also, selecting another way to sign in straight up did not work, and I had to sign in with my password anyway. The latest update has moved the app around in a worse way. Why can't I see my balance when I first open it anymore?",
