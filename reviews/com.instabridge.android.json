Something that, if I forget my phone or it's disabled for some reason, I can pull into a parking lot, find a hotspot, and make a call or send a text. And this exposes the glaring defect in Instabridge (and the many other WiFi finding apps that I've tried). They don't work without a data connection. When I say \"work\", I mean they do function somewhat, but not enough to be useful. For example, you can download a list of WiFi hotspots in your area. But, you can't browse them or look at them on a map unless you are online. The app does show you a short list of hotspots in your area that you can connect to for free, but unless you are online, it only shows what's in range of your WiFi, which is like finding a needle in a haystack. It'd be nice to show you, while OFFLINE, which WiFi hotspots were in your immediate area, even if your device couldn't detect them at the time, so you can drive or walk to them and connect. Worse, I couldn't get the list to refresh without restarting the app. I drove to the next town 3 miles over and the short list of hotspots from the town I'd just left was still displayed on the main screen, and it was still trying to connect to them. Which in some sense defeats the purpose. If you don't have data, you need this app to find a data connection, but it doesn't work without a data connection. So, it's probably great if you have really limited data, but enough to run the app. Outside of that, I don't understand the appeal.",
