I did have a little issue with notifications, but I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it seems to be working now (Android User). A couple of things to request to make this the next top tier in mobile financing: 1. Dark Mode (Many people mentioned this, but I'll be another one) 2. Widget for Home screen - It would be great for a quick view of balances for your account. Because you have more than one option for accounts, it would also be great to have a customizable setting for default views of either SPEND, SAVINGS, or Specialized pockets. 3. 4-digit MOBILE pin login instead of Password/email login. This is faster than entering both the email and password, and can be offered as an alternate security login for users. 4. Please change the account values from Total Cash to SPEND for the main balance shown. It can be confusing when looking at the Total Cash front and center when it's containing values from Savings and other pockets. Those are separate from spend and therefore shouldn't count as available to spend. I haven't set up my direct deposit as of now, but when I do, I'll do an update on my final review. I know this is all fairly new, but I do hope my requests are taken into consideration. Thank you!",

Finding an ATM feature is disasterly difficult to use, interface is a little too simple, and others. This bank is in no way bad, but being online only, it needs an amazing app.",

Can't swipe it away. 3) Transfers are set so Spend is the default to pocket, but 99% of the time that is not what I am transferring to. Why can't I set my own default?",

I spent a lot of time searching for an online bank with the features I wanted and a good app. Loved it all up until the new update for the phone app. Sorry guys, but it's bad now. It's ugly, it's not easy to navigate, and it's not the sleek, clean look that sold me on choosing this app. I don't like how the spend and save accounts are split between two screens, it was more convenient when it was all on one. It just feels like I'm using a cartoon now.",

Budgeting isn't about poorly categorizing where your money went; it's about defining where it should go. Their \"Pockets\" are a digital version of envelope budgeting and the spend pocket is essentially your discretionary spending that is safe to spend. This keeps you in track to keep funds for living expenses, structure debt, and with their save packets, secure your future. ONE is a great bank!",
