If you plan on playing this game w/ no money or minimal money spent, I wouldn't waste my time. Taking 2, 3, 4+ days to upgrade a building or training soldiers is wild. You spend more time waitin for upgrades/training than playing. I feel the building/training speed could be decreased so ppl spend more time playin rather than waiting.

The rules encourage bullying behavior. Stronger players are rewarded for attacking weaker ones. Could be a much better game with as few adjustments.",

      "text": "While the game does actually look and somewhat play as advertised, this is a micro transaction game to the max. The leveling up is a grind and the battles become pretty dull after a day or two. It has less to do with decision making on what to shoot down and more to do with if you level up your character. Which is locked behind time walls that require money to speed up and leveling which will also be time drains and or money spent. Overall it's ok, but still feels a bit misleading from as advert",

The main issue is the extreme pay to win, small upgrades bring huge advantages and the top players are wasting literally 10's of thousands, they are in the same 'world' as you, you cannot avoid them and due to the fully automated battles with zero skill input, you have absolutely no chance to win. You win this game by uninstalling or not installing to start with.",

Heroes, bases, foods, irons, etc. You might be into this type of things. But I just see this as another layer for people to pay for some \"progress\". This is not the game that I wanted. But clearly a lot of effort was put into these, the art and models are great, animations are surprisingly nice too. But, this is just too much for me.",

But there's no unified coin, very bad interface to know heroes tickets, diamonds, golden coins and whatsoever, there's also the stalker woman that brings something every minute to say \"hello\" 1.

Terrible if you want the game play shown in the most common ads, which I got to do a whopping 38 levels of before reaching my grinding and frustration limit, since that part is locked behind exponentially increasing progression requirements of the main gameplay, base building.",
